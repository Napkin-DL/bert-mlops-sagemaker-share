1,Good Buy for Pillowtop Foam Bed,I received the order in a timely manner. I am very pleased with the quality. I am using it on top of a water bed and it is very comfortable.
1,great all-around pressure cooker,this is my first pressure cooker and i use it ALL the time. 8-quart seems to be the perfect size. and the quality of this seems like it will stand up for many years.
0,"Ok, but ultimately unsatisfying","I found this book periodically enjoyable, periodically dull. The main flaw is the main character, who appears to a fantasized version of the author (note the similarity in names)."
0,Awful,"This is the worst Rush album ever. It lacks depth & imagination & sounds like it was recorded in a garage with a dictaphone. It's a shame because I was really looking forward to this album & was hoping I was going to hear something pretty diverse and interesting like the Rush of old, but I was severely disappointed & had to take it back to the store. In the past Rush have recorded some of my favourite material, but with this latest release they appear to have created a new genre of music - 'Regressive Rock.'"
1,Great book for your child!,"This is a must-have if your child likes silly adventures with animals, or just friendly characters. My daughter has quite a few of the Froggy books - she never gets tired of them!"
1,The Whipping Boy,The story was great but it was a short story.I liked the cut throats in the sewers when they threw the bird cage and the bird got loose and went after them.
1,The Crowes most beautiful best,"Lyrics, rhythms, choruses, uplifting climaxes, and down in the dirt depressing moments, this is the crowes all encompassing tour de force. Southern Harmony was great in its own right, but the line up(i.e. Ford and Harsch) was just warming up. Marc Ford is at his best, long bending notes that leave you hanging on for your life, incredible jams with rich and the gang. You can't go wrong, this is one of the great albums of the past 20 years if not all time. Descending, She Gave good sunflower (their greatest song title and one of their greatest songs as well), Non fiction, Conspiracy, Wiser Time, Ballad in Urgency, Gone, Cursed Diamond. Damn this album is good. Oh yeah, I forgot, High head Blues. Peace."
0,Makes Me Wish I Was Deaf,"This album sure makes me wish I was deaf!I bought this album for my little sister Melanie who is 5 because she was beging and crying for it.At first I thought what the hell i'll buy it for her,that was my biggest mistake to date.Hilary Duff is too ""goody goody""!And I don't like googy goody people.Not when they are too goody.My sister always puts a lot of volume to her stereo (yes she has a stereo,my momma buys her more stuff than me)and she always listens to that wake up song and it's really annoying and emberrasing because she puts maximum volume.I feel like a prisoner in my own home.She even puts it in the car I always have to listen to this bulls**T.Don't buy this ""most wanted"" album for yourself or for your siblings because it's not koooo!!!"
1,Just what we wanted.,"We have had a couple of these over the last 20 years. After our last one broke, I was going to ""upgrade"" to a better slow cooker made by another company. Big mistake. It only had High Low and Warm settings. It was always hard to find the right temperature. So after a year we bought this West Bend. It's nicer than our last one -stainless steel. But it performs the same, which is very well. We love that we can just pick up the pot and bring it to the table. The glass lid is clear so you can easily watch whatever your cooking. The only negative is that the metal lid handle can get a little hot."
1,Excellent Book for Young Adults.,"This is the first Kathe Koja book I have had the pleasure of coming across, and I can tell any other newcomer here that it won't be my last. I am taking a course in writing literature for children and young adults, and this book is exemplary for kids to read. It teaches so much about the dangers of low self-esteem, but also has a happy resolve for two of the characters, Maggy and Marianne. It also reminds me of my younger days when I was so much like Maggy and thinking that flirting with danger was ""cool."" What Koja's book teaches young people is that you can never be careful or confident enough not to get hurt but, if you're smart, you will learn from your mistakes and there is no seemingly overpowering person who can take you away from yourself unless you allow them to. A really good, fascinating story that draws you in and doesn't let you go until the very end. If Cole's lines weren't so hokey and old, you might fall for him through Maggy's eyes too!"
0,If you like lipsinking,If you like lipsinking you will like this set. There are some live performances but most are TV show performances with lipsinking. I was disappointed.
0,completely uninspired,If you liked the first album keep it and cherish it. Do not bother this load of garbage. I can't even use it as background music.
1,The Frontiersman,"This is the best book about the history of the area I live in I have ever read. The details are Great and I have Visiteed a Lot of Places Mentioned in the Book I have als seen The Play Tecumpseah, Trumpet in the Land and Blue Jacet After reading the Book and seeing theese Plays it Makes them come alive. I highly recomend it I have read it 4 times I sent the Only Copy I had to a Cancer Patient and Had to have another Copy. This is one Great Book. This book is also listed as Fiction but 95% of it is about True Places People and Actual Hapenings with very good detail and descriptions.Larry KemptonWaverly Ohio"
1,Warmbat Gekko Boots,"So very warm, snuggly, comfy. This is my second pair of Warmbats (had a pair a few years ago and wore them so much they eventually fell to pieces! Great price, and wonderful for those of us who don't like to have cold feet."
0,Could not finish the book,"This book was a reiteration of commonly known facts of relationships. I skimmed the chapters because reading each one was incredibly boring.Not worth the money, wish I had checked it out from the library instead of buying."
0,Disappionting!!!,A lot of re-hashed old songs that nobody cares about anymore.One of his worst to date! Co'mon Edwin...You can do better.Or has your time finally passed?
0,WARNING: This is a tuna byproduct...NOT flavored tuna...,"...with 13 grams of added vegetable fat!!While the label states that it contains 21 grams of protein, it also states there are 15 grams of fat, 13 of which are unsaturated...ie, from added vegetable oil [canola & soy..which have their own health issues].Compare this to G'Day's salmon products [a much fattier fish, BTW] which have only 99 calories for the same size servings!! [They don't add ridiculous amount of vegetable oil to this product for some reason].So, bottom line: this is a very unhealthy tuna fish byproduct...a macerated mess with so much oil added that it is guaranteed to put the pounds on! I got rid of mine...and I am writing this in the hope that others are at least aware of what they are buying. I wonder if the previous reviewers read the labels?"
0,a clone of the first,"this game is a clone of the first. let me tell you it sux. the gameplay is exactly the same there are no improvement on graphics and it is very predictable. also your character starts out less powerful then the others. basically it is predicatble,stupid,and not worth the money. if you want better forgotten realms games go for icewind dale or the original baldurs gate. but dont go for nwn or bg2"
0,Dying a slow death,"Reading this series has become painful! There is so little content, so little suspense and thrills that I have a difficult time staying engaged. What little substance there is to ""Desecration"" could be summed up in a few chapters. Literally! (...)"
1,"Worth to read,Supported by well documented historical facts","When I realized that this book was used in many other researches as a reference, I have decided to read it. Actually, I found it rational and accurate in listing true historical facts.Perhaps more details are needed in some places, but I think the writer intended not to fall in long historical stories. After reading this book, I have been motivated to read other valuable books mentioned in his bibliographie. I found him accuracte in quoting from those references."
0,Do Not Buy This Booster,"Booster chairs are wonderful. I love our The First Years seat. When I had a second child I bought this one. BIG MISTAKE. Whoever designed this should have their head examined. The straps come up though holes that are perfect for gathering food. The food then slips down between the seat and the base never to be retrieved. I have to turn the seat upside down and shake it after every meal. If I don't my dogs go crazy clawing at the seat. Buy a booster, just not ones with holes in the seat!"
1,Really great movie,"Classic movie,thanks a lot,I had a great time watching it,the best of the Halloween series,thanks again,I'll be buying some more."
0,End Times Prophecy and Conspiracy Theorist,"One should really open a book these days and not assume the title reflects the contents. Here are some highlights:The UN is going to try and take our money and redistribute it in their new world order, which is prophesied in the Bible as a sign of the end times.Those pesky homosexuals and women world leaders are inciting God's fury.NAFTA is the first step to the new world order, which would eventually abolish ordered government, eliminate private property and inheritance, abolish patriotism, rid the world of religion and destroy the family unit.Buy metals, coins, stocks, real estate and collectibles.Reduce debt, move to the country, have a 90 day food supply and water filters, stock up on medicines, pray and share the gospel.Sure, there is some information on our financial system peppered throughout the book, but the underlying conspiracy theories completely invalidate the veracity of this information."
1,Colgate Fresh Stripe is great! It left a ...,"Colgate Fresh Stripe is great! It left a good minty taste in my mouth after brushing. Even though it's a tartar control toothpaste, it didn't leave any grit or residue in my mouth like some other tartar control toothpastes do. It has a flip-top lid, which I prefer. Overall, my teeth and mouth felt very clean after using Colgate Fresh Stripe. I would definitely recommend this to my friends and family."
0,Not THE worst military techno-thriller ever.,"I can hardly begin to list the lacks found in this book. Minimal knowledge of aircraft both rotary wing and winged, nearly know knowledge of military ground tactics, equipment, organization or techniques. Near complete lack of correct usage of military terminology. The best thing I can say was that the author did get ""SEAL"" properly capitalized. If you're looking for a military thriller with accurate representations of people, equipment and plot, keep searching. This isn't it."
1,New Train--Smokes and Steams,"A master at work. This album was recorded in 1973, not released until 2000. A friend of mine just turned me on to it recently. It really holds up. The first track blows the doors off of most of the so-called R&B schlock you hear now. Hearing the original, song writer's version of ""Jet Airliner"" is a trip for those of us who grew up with the Steve Miller version. Jerry Garcia on pedal-steel, fat, tight gospel-style backup singers...GET THIS RECORD."
0,toothache,I purchased this item to have with me on hikes in case I need it to get to a dentist. I thought I would experiment first before really needing it. The product did not work. I tried using the material to temporarily cover the tooth and the stuff would not adhere to my teeth. The material just falls off?? I contacted the supplier and they gave me a refund right away which was good. So I am still looking for a product like this to have with me on hikes.
0,"Well Written, Yet Walks the Line","AS with any Brian McLaren book, we must have our Bible in hand to discern what is truly Scripture versus what is McLaren's liberal interpretation of Scripture. While McLaren is a brilliant gentleman and excellent teacher, his theology, while claimed to be orthodox Christianity, often mirrors other faiths more closely than it does Christianity. With some interesting points, I would not recommend this book for the novice who may be unable to discern truth from error."
0,came apart when dropped,"I had this lock for about two years. Then one morning I dropped it. It came apart exposing the interior cylinder made of plastic. The plastic was cracked in half. Although I was able to reassemble it, I have no faith in it's security value and will not use it again. I am replacing it with a Kryptonite New York Fahgettaboutit and hopefully I will be able to forget about it."
0,"You know, I really wanted to like it....","Ok. I'll admit it...the guy is funny, and he has written a funny book. But, halfway through, in the midst of my laughter, I realized something: These are real women I am laughing at! This book is Mr. Behrendt's nice way of calling all of us women naive and silly, and he is going to be the one profiting from our supposed inability to ""understand the male psyche""! Ladies, I can sum it up in one sentence: If you don't feel like the guy is crazy about you, and you spend hours analyzing every decision he makes (and making your friends do the same),then you probably deserve better. If you think you deserve flowers and romance and marriage, and he's not willing to offer it---go find a great guy that will. Yes, it is a funny book, but if you are looking for sound relationship advice, I just gave it to you for free."
1,Great Bait,Using this bait fot fishing trout. Have some great days using this floating baits with my 6'6 med fast action rod
1,"Incredible, straight-forward book about God's will for women","P.B. Wilson's book is a must-read for all young and older women alike. She tackles a lot of the hard issues in relationships, gives guidelines about dating, things to expect from and in a guy, and God's view on love, sex, and relationships. It is so healing to read through it and to be able to deal with problems that have been bothering me for some time. She encourages accountability and getting your relationship with the Lord to first priority before starting a courtship with a guy. In today's world of ""just do it,"" Mrs. Wilson's perspective is refreshing and radical. I highly recommend it to all ladies. I think it would be great as a women's Bible study."
0,Doesn't sound like Merle Haggard.,"If you're thinking about buying this CD, look it up on Amazon and listen to the samples of the songs. No one who listens to the songs first will buy the CD. ""Okie from Muskogee"" is the title, the songs listed were Merle's hits, and Merle's picture is on it. All of that is deceiving! Nothing printed on the CD indicates that it's anything except Merle singing some of his best songs; however, the voice doesn't sound like Merle Haggard, and none of the songs are sung with the right tune. I bought it on eBay at a low price, but it's not worth even the few dollars I paid for it. I should have listened to it on Amazon. This CD doesn't even deserve the one star I gave it, but that's the lowest it's possible to rate it."
0,so so,"The game seemed to start off like any other Nancy Drew game. My daughter has played them all. However, after a while, it seemed as thow it was an easter egg hunt for three year olds. Everything was easy to find and not mysterious at all. All the other games took my daughter quite some time before she figured out the mystery. However, this game took her two days. All the other Nancy Drew games kept her intrigued and kept her coming back for more. This game breezed by and and she was quite disappointed. In fact, her words at the end of the game were, ""that's it?"". Her interactive, better come out with a more interesting game next time or you'll lose the interest."
0,Mysteria: a cheap version of Enigma and Delerium,"While the album is acceptable for a random listen, Mysteria is B-grade music, but with the unforgivable sin of blatant copying of Moby, Enigma and others. There is plenty of room in the electronica space, no need to copy everyone; further, if you copy, you must make it better than the original. For example, the enigma-copy song has a bunch of blathering about infinity, serenity, divinity and other rhyming words, but it has no soul.Mysteria is the electronic equivalent of buying Safeway-brand products; a mildly watered-down and taste-alike version of the big brand-names. Only this time, you pay full price. :("
1,Very sturdy,"I needed an extra cooling rack. This one was the right price, and it is very sturdy. I'd recommend this product."
1,"Jerry Lewis Is A Legend, and the standard for COMIC excellence!!!","Jerry Lewis is sooooo funny!!! I Am twenty three years old, and i grew up on wonderful musicals, and classic movies, Laurel & Hardy...singing in the rain Oklahoma!!! sound of music, Seven Brides For Seven Brothers!!! this film is played to all my little family members age 3 to 30...and everyone loves it!!! I Know this movie will win over any fan of true comedy, and let me tell you, Jerry Lewis is credited for influencing comic icons like Jim Carey...when you watch this film you will see comic genius at his very best, this movie has more than any of his other films, Its Got Hilarious side splitting scenes...love!! it has drama...and very very charming!!! it has it all, you cant go wrong...IT IS A WONDERFUL TIMELESS TREASURE...YOUR KIDS WILL LOVE IT...I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS TO KIDS, OR GRANDKIDS, OR ANYBODY!!!!! THANKS I HOPE IT WAS HELPFUL"
1,EVERYTHING U'LL NEED,Your money is worth it. Everyting you'll need to bathe your child. Recommend it to everyone. Love the cute lil ducky.
0,Love soap operas? This is the book for you!,"Lisa Kleypas trots out all of of the old tried and tired formulas: 1.Young forbidden lovers permanently separated by a cold overbearing father. 2. Hero sent to a brutal taskmaster, he escapes, makes his fortune, swears vengeance. 3. Heroine disfigured in freak accident however scars are hidden but emotional scars are not, heroine remains a virgin. 4. Hero returns rich and successful to exact vengeance. 5. Hero and heroine rekindle their love. All is well. Happy ending.Slap on a more modern slant and you have the plot to a Melrose Place episode. Can you say melodrama? And the secondary plot was more of the same histrionics. Not a real likable character in the bunch. I couldn't finish this book. Don't waste your money. If interested in Lisa Kleypas buy some of her earlier titles."
0,another broken driveshaft,I haven't had my trimmer for more than 3 months when my driveshaft broke. My last trimmer lasted for 4 and a half years. I expected more out of this thing. When I called Troy they told me it wasn't covered. The driveshaft would cost $60. This sounds like an engineering issue to me.
1,Heated travel blanket is wonderful,I bought three Fleece heated travel blankets and gave two for christmas gifts .I love the one for myself and the ones receiving them as gifts thought they are the greatest gifts they received.
0,Very dry and boring,If you need something to put you to sleep read a couple of pages just before bed time.
0,Total Stephanie Plum Ripoff,It made me cringe as to how close this was to Janet Evanovich's Stephanie Plum Novels. Shame Shame Shame!!!!! Go find your muse and write something ORIGINAL. Sheesh.
1,Perfect instruction,"Wow! Just got this and it is great. I don't like a lot of exercise videos because some of the instructors tend to be goofy, flighty and overly bubbly. Or the instructors that have you do ridiculous routines such as that ""turkey dance"" in Jane Fonda's tape. (Oh puh-leeze!) It drives me nuts and the tapes sit on the shelf. Donna's style is perfect for me. She is friendly but not overbearing. She is serious about the exercises but she seems to have a lot of fun doing the workouts. She reminds of the proper form and breathing which is very helpful for me. I did three of the four workouts tonight and they were challenging but very do-able even for a beginner. As my legs get stronger I'll pop on my ankle weights to make this even more of a challenge. I'm thinking I'll be feeling it tomorrow. That's a good thing! Buy this tape. You won't be disappointed in my opinion."
0,This book is terrible - the 5 star reviews are fixed by one person,"Do yourself a favor. Read all of the non-5 star reviews here. Those are the genuine ones.All of the 5 star are from the same ""A Customer"" and obviously the same ""customer"" (author?).Save your money and get a better book with golf humor."
1,What a wonderful rich story,I thought the story was well done. The character background was fleshed out so well that I actually thought them to be real people. I thought the author caught the whole time frame very well. I highly recommend this book for a book club read.
0,Gift,cannot say if it was good or bad because the person who recieved it never made a comment so I am not sure..
1,I totally agree,ok i like both bratz and my scene dolls.why do u people even fight we are diffrent!!
0,Who Is Mike Jones?.....Who really cares?,"This cd is pure garbage, mike jones is a joke, all he does is use his phone number to sell his records, he cant rap at all chingy could probably take him in a battle. Dont get this cd its guys like him who ruin hip hop, go pick up BE or Streets Disciple and hear what hip hop should really sound like."
1,Fun and clever,A challenging mystery with a surprising conclusion. Fun to read and one to keep you guessing to the end. I enjoyed it very much.
0,Not recommended for a begginer,"As a beginner who want to try yoga (with no knowledge at all) this is defiantly not the DVD to recommend to start with.....find it difficult right at the begging with no explanation/showing on how to go easy on poses you cannot even think to perform...also, was fast to learn it that I needed to do return- back so many times till I got sick & tired from this DVD...NOT recommended for any beginner at all!"
0,Technical Issues,"The disc played in my Samsung Blu Ray player with great difficulty. At 11:19 it kept locking up, so I had to skip those chapters in order to see the concert. The menu caused my player, a Samsung with all the latest firmware upgrades, to lock up. Chapter selection was unavailable as were the extras. Why did they even ship this knowing full well it would not function with Blu Ray players- see other reviews about this as well. I am not the only one having problems with the bluray version."
1,Thank you so much !,"I love Fall Out Boy and now, with this CD, my collection is completed ! :) I'm so happy, thank you !"
0,waste of money,I really hated this movie regretted even buying it. I didn't feel that it was authentic to the period at all. I also thought it looked more like local play instead of a movie!!! Don't waste your time and money
1,Gavin oh Gavin!,"This is (was) a extreamly fun and talented band. I have seen them live so many times and each time they just got better. If you have the doe or even if you don't (borrow it) buy this and MWG to educate yourself on this great band from Alabama (the best thing to come from there in a long time). I love this album so much I named my son Gavin after ""Gavin"" off of there first disc and then this one later. ""seven inch cowboy"" should give you a good laugh, and I believe that ""suckerpunch"" is only out done by ""square pegs"" on MWG. ""The man upstairs"" is really well done and you should learn the words, it makes a great sing a long."
0,You should read the forums for its known problems before buying this router,"This router has several bugs and D-Link doesn't even bother fixing them by releasing a better firmware. If you read the forums, you will find out yourself about the problems and the frustration of the users. Also the technical support of D-Link operating from India is useless, they will waste your time, but the problem will stay there. In a nutshell, don't buy this router unless you want to face all those known issues."
1,Beef Jerky Heaven,"This was the best beef jerky I've ever had! Bar none! It shipped quicker than I expected and man though was it worth the wait!!! If I could, I would buy a life time supply!! No other beef jerky I've had could ever hope to match up against Buffalo Bill's!"
0,WHAT A BORE!,"Not enough originality to this one. Boring plot and characters. I thought the novel read like a 60's TV show, and I sure didn't like all the profanity."
0,warning: DO NOT READ THIS BOOK!,"Alright, I've been studying Wicca for quite some time. Honestly, this book is all wishy washy, teeny kids stuff. It is very misleading to the novice, if one has read this book, please read other ones! There is Scott Cummingham, A Guide to the Solitary Practioner, and The Truth About Wicca Today, start off with that, PLEASE. Then branch off to other things. This book has some, And i repeat, some truth, (maybe about 1 or 2 percent at the most) But most of it is hocus pocus nonsense. There is also the Spiral Dance by Starhawk which is much more indepth. There are so many, MANY other books out there. Read one of those. I wouldn't recommend this book to ANYBODY, let alone a beginner. I don't even know if RavenWolf is a pagan. ::sigh:: Well, get some of the old stuff, there are plenty of good books out there, you just have to find the right one."
1,A Must See Real Good Thriller/Ghost Movie,"When I learned that this movie was made by the same guy, Orrichio, who made Abduction, Requiem for a Vampire and Black Ribbon, I knew I had to see it. He has amazing talent and imagination, and it shows in every one of his movies. Dreams Of The Dead is a first class mystery/thriller/ghost story that exceeded all my expectations. It's an excellent movie with twists and turns that kept me glued to the screen. This is one movie you don't want to miss if you like mysteries and ghost stories."
0,Disappointed,"I ordered the CD, hoping for one particular cut from the movie, ""Boom Shak a Lak - Apache Indians"" and didn't get what I wanted. However, I do enjoy the version of ""Safety Dance"" that's here, so I've kept the CD."
1,An excellent song.,"I like a lot this Version, I have O-zone versions, but this version is much better!! I liked more Haiducii than O-zone, and this is not that Romania Hit, ""Dragostea din tei is excellent""; it's a pity you can not find the other single of Haiducii ""Mne Stoboy Horosho"" in this single you can see what is Haiducii, not just ""Dragostea Din Tei"", because Haiducii is excellent!!! I like Ozone too, but I prefer Haiducii!!!"
0,Good book but the price kills it's value.,This really is a good book. Lots of new monsters to add flavour to a campaign. Anything that adds to the campaign is a good thing. But for this product the cost is very high. Roleplaying books have always been expenisve. But this one pushes it too far. I walked away from D&D over 10 years ago. The only thing that has got me excited again was when I picked up the players guide and saw the content and price. I bought it and the DM's guide and I am certainly going to buy more. I am VERY excited about the new look and the new direction the game is taking.But this one book leaves a bitter taste in the mouth. If you don't have it buy the Monster manual instead.
0,Marc's review,"This album is quite interesting. The lead singer has a good voice to go along with good music. I heard ""halo"" and i had to get the cd. It is worth your money to get it."
1,True Music for the Soul... A MUST HAVE for any music fan..,"The long anticipated debut album from Bilal Oliver is finally here!!! To make this short and simple, Bilal puts his heart and soul onto every track on this album. It is a must have for any music fan. Every song is authentic in it's own way. That's enough, GO GET THE CD, ..."
1,Love it!,A timeless classic that all should read as youth and adults. Thouroughly enjoyed the whole book. Our book club of twenty women enjoyed it as well.
0,DISGUSTING!,"I guess it all comes down to... whether you like hip hop/rap or not. I actually HATE it and feel like the songs were completely ruined. I've liked Sergio Mendes since I was little and I almost cried when I heard this. I'm sure some people will enjoy it but if you don't like Black Eyed Peas and stuff like that, you will definitely not like this."
1,good book,Alaska's wolf man is an adventure everyone should read.Frank Glaser did everything from traping to dog sled freight hulling to government hunting. he knew how to hunt even the smartest animals and train the best sled dogs. My favorite part was when he bred half wolf half husky sled dogs. they where the best dogs in town. he also shot wolves from a airplane! a great story for anyone.
1,Great Product!,"Arrived quickly, and just like it's shown...nice material, great price. Works perfect with my Day-Timer refills, so far I'm very impressed, we'll see how it holds up!"
0,Damaged,"Calendar was damaged when arrived. Box was beat up and the calendar inside the box was crinkled and torn. I was happy with the item itself, just wish it would have arrived in better shape."
0,VERY Dissappointing!,First time I've ever bought anything to watch on Amazon Online viewing and am incredibly dissappointed. The quality sucks and the video pauses to load every 10 seconds no matter what format I've tried. iTunes sells the same product for $34.99 - it would have been worth the extra money in the first place. Instead of $34.99 I have to pay $53.00 since I wasted my money using Amazon Online viewing.
0,Junk,I expected more from the Oxo brand. I was hoping the mandoline would make quicker work of meal preparation. The knives are dull. You have to wiggle the vegetables through the unit. Spend your money on a good chef's knife.
1,Why Was This CD Discontinued?,"I happened upon this cd at a store that is no longer open here in Columbus, a little store called Camelot Records. I loved going there on my days off and sifting through all the bins looking at obscure titles, just like this one. The reason I bought this cd is because I recognize Bunny's name from the thousands of artist's she sang back up for, so I trusted the material contained within. ""Talking With The Angels"" is my favorite track, the album as a whole is thoroughly enjoyable and contrary to the jazz label, the music is not jazz, but straight up pop. The production is flawless for pop music and listening to Bunny's clear voice, it's easy to understand why she is in such demand for backing sessions for other artists. I wish her solo catalog was a bit more accessable."
1,~Highly Intoxicating~,Ok...Everytime I put this on my Sweetheart is all over me!..Lol...I've had complete strangers asking me what scent I'm wearing b/c it smells so good..Women and Men!...This will be my signature scent from now on!
0,"Nice idea, but doesn't cut well at all...","I love the slightly curved design with safety tips, the compact size (easy to sneak up on my dog's face to trim) and the price wasn't so bad. Unforunately, the scissors aren't sharp and don't even cut my schnauzer's soft fluffy hair. Wish I'd gotten these locally so I could return them without a hassle. Don't bother with these."
0,Boring,"I wanted to learn more about the life of Bobby Darin. Yes, those of us who weren't born back in the 30's, 40's, and 50's, still know of him.I could have done without the fantasy song and dance sequences - I felt those detracted and distracted from the storyline."
0,HORRIBLE SUPPORT SYSTEM,"The product works - until it has a bug. The bug is theirs - not something you've done - but if you want it fixed, you'll pay a fortune for support. I've never been so frustrated in my life!I finally got a support tech on the phone. I had to keep asking him what he was saying because his English was poor. His answers were nothing short of ridiculous (Nuance doesn't support Windows XP platforms)??????I asked to speak to his supervisor THREE times but he was busy. I asked for a call back....and you guessed it, no return phone call. I can't say I was surprised. I wrote a letter (snail mail kind) to the CEO of Marketing and Support, and copied a senior board member. I doubt it will change one darn thing but it made me feel better.I'll never buy another Nuance product again."
0,Big Disappointment,"I was excited to expose my baby to baby einstein so I tried this video first. While the images got my baby's attention for the whole 30 minutes, I was concerned about the language confusion. Not only the language and images are sometimes not related, but I think that mixing so many languages can be confusing for a baby who's trying to figure out language.I'll try baby mozart and see how my baby responds to it."
1,Worth every penny & more,"I saw this item reviewed & tested on America's Test Kitchen, Cook's Illustrated Cooking Show on PBS TV a few months ago. For my Birthday in December I asked my husband for one.I have not been disappointed. It allows all the loose tea to absorb water and you get the most wonderful tasting tea. I can buy a wide variety of loose tea from my local Earth Fare and of course on the internet. The hardest thing to do is keep it clean to make the next glass of tea. If I were a hostess and serving others tea, I would definitely upgrade to the larger version. Oh and my Mother wants one too! Her birthday is coming up soon. Thanks Adagio for making an Eco-friendly and BPA Free item for today's generation."

0,Fall Out...and DIE,"When I first heard the samples of each song from this album, I wondered where I heard Fall Out Boy before, and then it hit me.Fall Out Boy sounds deathly similar to New Found Glory, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and Blink 182.This is interesting because none of these bands have an ounce of talent and yet they all seem to play the exact same song over, and over, and over again.Will some young aspiring musician figure out how to make a rock song again, and put an end to the filth that is polluting the radio airwaves.Whatever happened to the good days of The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Doors, Led Zeppelin, Bob Dylan, The Who, and Jimi Hendrix? Wait! I know they were replaced by filthy ""musicians"", most commonly known as Fall Out Boy, New Found Glory, Simple Plan, Good Charlotte, Sum 41, and Blink 182."
0,Totally lame,"I bought this album based on the glowing reviews on Amazon and boy am I disappointed. Music lacks originality, lyrics are trite. Would have given it 0 stars if that rating had been available."
0,Ew,"Pop-lovers, and raving newbies rejoice...your album has arrived. Trance lovers...avoid this at all cost. Dont get me wrong, its a good album for trance newbies, or all those of you that get your trance from MTV, and have attended 2 raves, one of which you slept through."
0,B-o-o-o-o-o-ringggggggg,"I bought this book mainly going by the O'Reilly name which usually has excellent books (Java, Motif), but this book is like listening to a theoretical computer science prof. drone on and on... It literally took me three months to get through just chapter two. I kept falling asleep every time I tried to read it! Most of chapter two consists of cut-and-pasted bulleted lists each one defining a zillion terms w/o justification. So, we don't say 'acquired', we say 'captured'. Great! Can you say 'pedantic', boys and girls?Bottom line is that when an author keeps using big obfuscated words for no good reason where simpler ones would do (e.g. 'facilitate' v/s 'ease') you know you are in trouble. He is obviously writing to impress his colleagues, not to educate his readers..."
0,a defamation text,"This is actually an anti-simitic text that claims that Judaism is descended from the Khazars. One problem with this argument is that many Jews actually do resemble their arab and Simitic cousins in the middle east. Many Palistinians have fair, blond, features, but that doesn't mean they are not Arabs, it just means they intermingled with europeans crusaders. The reality is that the Khazars NEVER immigrated to Khazaria, they were whiped out by the mongols. Most of the tribes of the Caucuses were not emigratory tribes, like the armenians and Georgians and Chechens, they were sedintary and like the Khazars they weathered the storm of invasion. Unfortunatly the Khazars did not weather the storm very well and they disappeared, but they NEVER moved to europe and this book is full of hateful remarks and polemics against the Judiasm, very offensive."
1,worked and great to have extras,My child plays an instrument and loves the Kun shoulder rest compared to the foam ones. You should order these and have an extra pair incase lost.
0,Disgusting,"I have been waiting for years to actually see a Robert Jordan book that follows what was in the first 7. All those books, while having some filler in them, were action packed. (...). Repackaging a book that has already been released into two books will end up [confusing] people who have already bought ""The Great Hunt"", and will end up annoying more people than it pleases. The greed in this stunt is disgusting, and I honestly feel that he has alienated many people with it."
1,Really long but not dragging,"I was surprised by how long this book is - I was expecting it to just skim over extinction of a few species and make its conclusion. Instead, it is a thorough and detailed account of the history and the science behind the natural world today. Great for both the people who know a lot about natural science and those who are simply curious. This book reads more like a good blog than a report, with opinions and personal experiences of the author included among in the drier retelling of scientific theories. I would highly recommend it - don't be afraid of its thickness, because you won't be able to put it down."
0,"If I could give it a ""0"" I would","Worst. GAME. EVER. That pretty much sums it up. I tried for 2 days (4hrs each Day to give it a chance. All you get to see are cut scenes at random, in no specific order, and some gaming graphics that resemble an NES games from the early 90's. THAT. IS . ITAlso, I paid $10.00 for this stupid game. And guess what??? Amazon wouldn't take it back, and I ended up trading it for.....$1.25 ... Not only will you feel the huge let down that this games becomes quickly, but it will take your money and rip you off too."

1,Best Purchase of 2006!,"Thinking about 2006 I would put this laptop as the best purchase I made; even beating some classics as the Kitchen Aid mixer. It is fast, beautiful, has so many show off features (both in software or hardware), and I just found out I can get Vista Ultimate and run it in the maximum mode it can run. This laptop is just awesome!"

1,Up-front experience of war and how it effects real people.,"Elma Softic has allowed us to read her personal diary and correspondance to family members about how the war in Sarajevo effected her family, friends, neighbors, and herself personally. Sometimes graphic, always honest, and frequently emotionally charged. Helped me prepare for what I was about to see when I travelled to Sarajevo recently, and how to best help the people left behind."
0,"""Never operate in moving vehicle""","Like others, I did a lot of research before choosing the SD-P1850. The description of the unit says ""Take your favorite entertainment on the road with you and keep your kids entertained during long car trips with the slim-profile Toshiba SD-P1850 portable DVD player"". Imagine my surprise when I read the owner's manual and in several places it warns "" Do not operate the player in a moving vehicle. Vibration may prevent proper playback or cause damage to the disc."" And ""Do not use the player in a place subject to vibration."" And yet, it includes a vehicle adapter. What are we supposed to do with it? Send the kids out to the car to watch videos while the car remains in the driveway?"
1,More Painless Than Using Dictionary!,"Dealing with Painless series of BARRON'S, I came to learn more efficient ways to lighten my loads of my mind. Although Painless Vocabulary involves a lot of big words, I'm sure every exercise enhances your technique to build up your vocabulary and practice reading the contexts. You will be able to solve every brain ticker if you read the explanation of words BEFORE using your dictionary. And of course, Eng.-Jpn. dictionary and vice versa don't help. Both of them don't explain core meanings of each word, if you ask me. On top of that, it IS a waste of time and energy!After all, this book is going to help you reinforce your flexibility to tackle your new words!"
1,Absolutely amazing!!,"Love! Love! Love!! If you are looking for the perfect girls night out movie, this is it!! You will want to watch it over and over for the eye candy! :)"
0,Rent it Before you Buy it. .,"As with volume 1, it could be a great anime but rent it first. If you can't watch it, it doesn't count for much. The discs don't play on all machines, same problem in the coding as the first. Bandai knows of the trouble with the discs but hasn't said anything about it or if they'll be doing anything about it. So again be warned."
1,Catch them on their way to the top!,"I have been watching these guys play for almost two years now, and they continue to get better. Their live show is absolutly amazing, and I worried about how the live show would transfer onto a CD. When they play, they play, and play, and then play some more. Twenty minute songs are not unheard of, and this can be hard to tranfer to a cd. But they did it, and did it right. The CD is a great listen all the way through, and it can keep repeating and never get old. I have accumulated almost 20 hours of their live shows, and the cd really does them and their music justice. It really does not matter what kind of music you like, you will like this, because it is just great music."
0,Don't buy direct from ultimate chopper,"I purchased this item directly from the Ultimate Chopper web site and their policy said they would not bill you until the product was shipped. They lie about this. I was billed on Nov. 3, 2004 for this item and still as of Nov. 18, 2004, I have not received it. They said that on Nov. 3 my order was sent to warehouse for packing and shipping. So that gives them the right to bill me???? One thing nice about Amazon you can count on them to bill you WHEN they ship the item."
0,No split-track,"This is partly my fault, but I like the karaoke CD's with the option to sing with or without the music. The ""Billboard"" brand is the only one that I have found with this capability."

0,I couldn't stay awake,"I am an avid science fiction reader and I must say that this is one of the most boring books I have ever read. Baxter may know his science, but he has much to learn about fiction. I kept hoping for some action or at least something interesting to happen, but all I got was boredom. This author has disappointed me twice and there will not be a third chance."
0,A Dull Read Best Skipped,"This was the worst of the Grisham books. I cannot believe that some people are writing good reviews of this book. Grisham's book was not only boring, dull, anti-climatic, shallow, but also inaccurate in estate tax law. Mr. Grisham, if you write law novels, at least be accurate about the law! Giving this book two stars is charity."
1,Academy nominee for leading actor,"The plot of the movie is a dark pscychological thriller without your usual graphic gore and expected hollywood shocker ending. The story deals with an alter ego or split personality in a man that was abused as a child by his mother. Murphy's performance as Emma is superb. He makes you believe you are watching the transformation of a beautiful, shy and soft spoken woman into a secure, assertive one. I cannot think of any other actor who could have pulled this off as beautifully as he did, since he does have an incredible talent and androgynous features with wig and drag. If you want to watch a great and unique performance, you wont be disappointed."
1,Predictable but fun,"Matthew McConaughey, sporting a new moustache and dark hair, plays a treasure hunter who is seeking an iron-clad, Civil-war era ship which he thinks ended up in Africa. (Don't even ask how this could happen!) He borrows his boss's boat and aided by his faithful sidekick (played perfectly by Steve Zahn) he sets out on his search. Coincidentally he crosses paths with a beautiful doctor from the World Health Organization (Penelope Cruz) and soon her quest to find the source of a mysterious disease combines with his search for the boat. This movie is totally predictable, but it is slick and quite entertaining. If you're not in search of great art, but are looking for an action and adventure-filled evening of entertainment, this just might fit the bill."
0,its ok,"Well, I JUST got it today, I had an older model of dirt devil which was a bit heavier which I liked because I felt I had more control over than this one, the flimsy small wheels on the bottom are difficult to navigate on carpet making it feel like your not in control and it is quite loud, There is a slight smell while/after vacuuming as if the motor is burning up already after 1 small trial run, but I'll find out about that hopefully within a few weeks, the verdict is still out with this particular model, I paid 119.99, but paid like 1/2 the price for the dirt devil before this one and so far feel more comfortable with THAT model. My mother in law purchased a whirlwind Eureka and said it rocks, but I was hesitant since my last Eureka's motor burned out the 1st month of use! (which is why Im a dirt devil fan now, our DD lasted for about 5 years + now!)I'll let you know in a few months! :)"
1,Wow... how did this one slip through?,"This is one of those movies that will be a classic 20 years from now. This one completely slipped through the theater release hype (they must have had a small media buy). Much like Groundhog Day, this film slipped through theaters without a peep, but will be seen countless times on cable. It's a comedic take on love, life, and the end of the world. Very subtle, funny, witty, well acted, and poignant film. This one is worth repeat viewings. Very cool music soundtrack. Even if it's the end of the world and your time is limited this film is worth viewing."
0,Has 3 year life max.,"TV was great until it started having trouble not turning on. Would power on then shut off instantly before the picture could even come on. This started out happening for 5-10mins before it would turn on for good. Now it doesn't come on at all anymore. In my opinion Samsung offers the best picture quality bar none. But they should be ashamed to produce a product with a 3yr life and not jump on the problem right away. From what I've read, this is a common problem. I have another (newer model) 55"" Samsung. Hope this doesn't have the same fate."
1,Awesome for the money,"Just got this not too long ago and I have to say that I am quite impressed. It feels sturdy, isn't super heavy and I feel comfortable sticking my Rebel on it. I wouldn't recommend it to use for shooting video as it doesn't pan super smoothly. Overall, you can't beat the price on this tripod, considering how well built it seems. I will probably update my review after I have had it longer than two weeks."
0,Pathetic Retelling of the Book of Mormon,"Having read the Book of Mormon, I was surprised that this had series had received any praise at all, and I am even more surprised by the reviews that state how ""original"" this story is. Card's retelling of the Book of Mormon in this series is pathetic - the story is lifted almost directly from the Book of Nephi in the Book of Mormon, the science fiction twist on this Book of Mormon story comes across as pedestrian, the writing is drawn out and exacerbating for most of the book, and the character development is just sad.If you want a better telling of this story then read the Book of Mormon.If you are not interested in reading the Book of Mormon then I suggest you stay away from Mr. Card pathetic Memory of Earth series."
1,A mad whirlwind,"King has you going every-which-way in this book. And as an author who has broken every convention, he commits his biggest sacrilege ever in this book by writing himself into the story.As a fan you can take it though - and if you've read all the books up to this point don't stop now - there's even something magical about it.Most people know how close to death King really was. And in this book I think he is trying to reach out to his readers, and say ""thankya."" But with all of his money, wealth, agents, and fame it is hard to find the sincerity in his plea. The plea to be taken as a true writer and artist. Something the critics will never give him in his lifetime.I'm bias, so of course I want to believe. And I look for the meaning in these books and there are times when I think I've found it, and then, like a dream it fades away . . ."
1,Look forward to it every month,"First, I really love Oprah. I find her inspirational, fun, and thought provoking. This magazine is a reflection of all of that. I love getting it in the mail. The articles are intelligent and interest me as a woman, entrepreneur, and mother."
0,"Horrible graphics, even for a Wii","I just want to say that I know the Wii does not have the video output of an XBOX360 or PS, but the graphics in Tiger Woods Golf '08 are horrible. I have a 50"" plasma that the Wii is hooked up to and do not really have any issues with other games (Mario Galaxy looks great), but the text you have to read in the Tiger Woods game is pretty much unreadable. The courses look great, but if you can't read half the text what's the point!"
1,The only towing mirror for a 2010 Subaru Forester,"These are the ONLY towing mirrors I have found that actually work with a 2010 Subaru Forester.Subaru does not make towing mirrors.I have complained to them about this and they didn't seem to comprehend that many small fiberglass trailers are within the tow specs of many of their vehicles.For a company that prides itself on safety they miss the boat completely with mirrors.That said, simple clip on mirrors are TERRIBLE, do not waste your money.They vibrate and are useless.These mirrors are sturdy, and while they take some time to set them up properly they are well worth it.Now I can see around my Trillium trailer and I no longer hold my breath when switching lanes.These mirrors, along with my P3 break controller take the stress out of towing."

0,Concerned about Amazon's pricing scheme rating based on false pricing scheme,I got an email saying this set was on-sale for 19.99. So I went to buy it but on the site it says that it is on sale for 29.99 shipping from Target. So I went directly to the Target site and was amazed to see the list price is only $32.99 yet Amazon has their list price at $50+. Makes me wonder what else they have over priced. I like to shop at Amazon but now I am concerned. Make sure to double check the prices else where.
0,WAS an Excellent value and easy to adjust,"I must say that after reading some of the comments I was a little worried about the quality of the watch, however after wearing it now (24/7) for a solid two weeks I am happy with the product and feel that it is certainly worth the money. I am a woman with small wrists and this works just fine (I like chunky watches). The strap is very easy to adjust..in fact just search ""adjust watch strap"" on a YouTube like site and there are plenty of videos out there to help you with step by step instructions...(the watch comes with operational instructions but nothing for adjusting the band). At this price-point, this is a great watch if you're already familiar with IRONMAN products or if you're ready to try IRONMAN out for the first time.****UPDATE Summer 2010****Indeed.... it ended up breaking in a spot where I was unable to fix (a piece of material chipped off right where the pin fits into the watch... Boo. Great looking...bad construction!! I do NOT recommend!"
0,funny furby story,"I have a funny story about the original Furby. I was teaching in a small private school. We had just passed a ""NO FURBIES"" rule for obvious reasons. We didn't even want to hear them from the cubbies. About an hour after school started, I got a call from the mother of 2 of our girls who owned several Furbies each. Mom was frantic. She was at a red light and desperate to get all these Furbies to shut up, but the more she yelled at them, the more they talked to her. I told her she was going to have to get all of them to go to sleep and to imagine why we had to pass a rule against having them in our small space. I don't think she allowed them in her car again."
0,poor color transfer on cups,"I expected the dishes to be more substantial. The plates are very light and thin, more like melamine in feel. The colors on the dinner plates and bowls are like in the pictures seen on the internet so they are what I expected. Very disappointed with the cups- I bought two sets, and only 1 of the 8 cups had ALMOST the same color intensity as the dinner plates-the others were so faded (kinda like when your color cartridge in your computer is outta ink) they looked like, either rejects,or they had gone through a heavy load dishwash 100 times"

1,Great toner and first aid!,"Over the past year I gradually replaced all the expensive, chemical-laden, brand-name cosmetics with simple and inexpensive organic beauty products. The skin gel was one of the first products that I bought and I am very happy with it. I apply it on my face and entire body as a toner/moisturizer after shower. A little goes a long way. Just a pea-sized drop can cover my face. It leaves a smooth, thin layer on my skin which dries quickly but locks in the moisture and tighten the pores. On top I put on some heavier lotion.I have combination skin that's acne prone. With regular night moisturizers, I often wake up to a layer of oil which makes me look like I just spread butter all over my face. It's the skin's own instinct to overproduce sebum to compensate loss of moisture. When I use the skin gel as a toner, however, in the morning I would see relaxed, well-moisturized skin."
0,Fails to recognize the beauty of Faulkner's lingusitc style,"Kazin in his 1942 assessment of Faulkner's writing as ""incoherent and ungrammatical"" is completely without merit. Any literary scholar with a basic understanding of linguistics can see the importance of Faulkner's writing not only as a genre, but as a launching pad to further understanding of his complex and cherished characters."
0,Careless hodgepodge of undergraduate random notes,This poor book is a careless mess of random notes about psychology. There is no systematic theory behind the presentation. Look elsewhere for an intelligent summary of the field.
1,Grab it and go!!!,"It does everything and best of all comes with everything...all the electronic adapters included, headset, remote, case. There are no game cartridges to buy or carry.

0,NEVER LIKED THE HAIR BANDS,"I never really liked the hair bands, but iron maiden has to be the worst of the bunch.This album, much like all of their others, are just plain dull and boring. If you think 'load' from metallica is bad listen to this and you will change yor mind. At least metallica has gotten better since then. If you like britney spears and the backstreet boys, you miight like this album.Don't worry pantera or metallica, this isn't much of a threat. Hopefully ths will be the last cd released by the kings of ""cheese, pop metal"""
1,Fleas be gone!,"I saw a flea on our kitty!!! So I ordered this Frontline for Cats and Kittens. Acceptable price, got it fast, no more fleas. Yay for Amazon!"
0,...it's okay,"It's not as funny as Hangover many things seem recycled from that movie not to mention other movies. In this movie Zach Galifianakis, like in Hangover, plays a sort of lonely sad idiot who seems to have no friends, has a penchant for drugs, gets other people in trouble, and then makes them want to kill him and at the end of the movie somehow, for some reason they (or in this case him, Robert Downey Jr's character) forgive him. There other similarities that I don't want to give away. Anyway, I just found it mostly boring. There might have been maybe a few laughs here and there but it mostly seemed boring, recycled and unfunny to me but, hey judging by the number of positive reviews chance are you might like it. If you liked Hangover you MIGHT like this one. A couple of beers...or whatever could possibly help you enjoy this film even more but chances are if you didn't like the Hangover then you won't like this one..."

So everytime I opened the phone it would pull up my call history and start calling automatically. So I returned the phone for a replacement... Mind you that its barely April and the MP3 player doesn't work anymore. It freezes and then just turns off. The picture quality on this phone isnt what I expected it either. Then the texting fuction isnt very user friendly. As I was writing this review I was sending a text and the phone just turned off. Also, the battery life isnt very good either. The phone is constantly freezing.Looks wise... the phone is great! Its a beautiful phone. But other than that it doesnt have anything else going for it."
0,Poor way to spend your money!,"I bought this item for my 5&7 year old boys who love using mommy & Daddy's cameras. This is the biggest piece of junk. When you look through the view finder the picture is centered, but when you take the picture half the picture is cut off! It was very frustrating to the kids and the parents. Let's not talk about quality. The quality is less than poor. The pictures are grainy, fuzzy and out of focus(no matter what lighting situation). My kids were looking forward to downloading the pictures to the computer to print them off, but they are so grainy it's not worth the money or effort. This may be a good toy for a younger child, but I DO NOT recommend for older kids. POOR CHOICE! Put your money towards a cheap real digital camera!"
1,M2: TW Kingdoms,"Kingdoms is an expansion to Medieval 2: Total War. In the expansions to previous Total War games, the developers focused exclusively on one area of the main game's campaign map. In this expansion, each primary area of the map has its own unique campaign.Each unique campaign has its own set of new elements added to both game play and unit builds.The Kingdoms expansion is very much a value added product. And, as with all the games in this franchise, there is even more potential for extended replayability and enhanced enjoyment once the modders have their go at tweeking and mutating it to fit their own wants and ideas. The Total War franchise has a very strong and dedicated modder base."
0,Fun to read,"In praise of Crichton's new book, I can say that it was fun to read, but not much else. It's very obvious from the writing that he did quite a bit of research into the Middle Ages, but there's very little that would be new information to anyone who's taken any European history course. The quantum theory he uses to justify what is essentially a form of time travel is based in fact, but fantastic descriptions littered with meaningless jargon place the process well outside the boundary of reality. The plot devices he uses are old and threadbare, and the characters are stereotypical to an absurd degree. He did keep the plot moving, however, and taken as nothing more than a typical action book, it was a decent read."

0,The Little Lord Fauntleroy of Rap,"Did you guys know that ""C-Murder"" grew up in Stamford, Connecticut, and went to a private school, where he excelled at horseback riding and modern interpretive dance? Did you know he took another boy to his senior prom? Did you know that he started out performing bubble-gum music (as lead singer for a ""wholesome"" n'sync ripoff called The Copy Boys) but switched to rap when his manager told him he'd make more money pretending to be a gangster? Did you know that he's a teetotaler and has never touched a woman? Did you know that he was once caught in a bathroom stall with George Michael?

Sure, I believe that.)But if believing that this boy's a scary thug helps you get through the day, keep on believing it."

0,Kinde Edition do Not buh,"Kindle Edition does not have any pictures, illustrations or maps that makes electronic addition useless. If electronic edition would not be updated to include pictures, tables etc it is just waste of money, don't buy it."
1,Bingo,I heard it being played as background music in a store & inquired the title of the album. Of course i followed it up on the net & bingo I got it from you.
1,Beautiful,"This is a beautiful account of life in the circus in the 1930s. Often sad and reflective, I found this book a joy to read."
1,hardware,"I have seen alot of negative reviews on this film and dont understand why.This is a very good straight forward beginning to end film,not like others where your 45 mins or so into it,and still have no clue as to what is going on.A quick summary of movie.Man buys android parts,gives android parts to girlfriend,android re-builds and reactivates itself,kills anything it comes into contact with.For all the people,who gave this film negative reviews need to get their heads out of their ass,and appreciate a good film when they see one.I highly recommend watching or owning."
1,A beginners guide with substance and value!,Since I had no background with SQL Server I carefully chose a beginners guide and am very pleased with this one. I was able to understand all but 2 or 3 short segments of the material and I anticipate using this book as a syntax reference later on. The author's background with databases was evident without being overwhelming. There were at least a dozen mislabeled figures or tables that could be misleading and the first two thirds of the book are heavy going as Transact-SQL is covered but I found the writing consistently accessible. The chapters on Data Warehouses and Data Marts were too sketchy to be of much value but the main point of the book was handily accomplished - the basics of building and managing SQL Server 7 databases. I am reading the MS Press self study guides currently and am glad I started where I did.
0,Lid broke after 1 year.,"We really liked this garbage can, however the gears and connection to the lid are all made of plastic and it broke after 1 year of use. Will probably buy a step can as a replacement. Disappointing."
0,not well-written,"I can't really evaluate the topic since it's all true, but I found the author to be a bit too wordy for my personal tastes and I did find the book slow (due to his writing style, not the topic). This surprised me because apparently he is a best selling author. Also, I was a bit put off by the author's sarcasm, I didn't feel it was appropriate given the weight of the story and it felt disrespectful to the deceased. As a forensics buff I enjoy true crime. The story itself was downright bizarre, but it just goes to show you anything can happen in this world; there is so much evil out there."
0,Minimally useful,"I found this product minimally useful. To find out how to clear errors, you have to two locations in the book which is a nuisance. Instructions on other operations were not clear."
0,Great until they break,"I've had about 6 pairs of these over-glasses sunglasses. On each pair, after about 6 months to a year or so, one or the other of the temple (over the ear) pieces breaks (usually the left side) and cannot be repaired or replaced, so a new pair must be purchased. The temples are obviously manufactured to be fragile and break after slight use or exposure to sunlight UV rays. I am sick of planned obsolescence. We are making China rich and sending tons of junk to the landfills."
0,Contains NO Stencil,"Please don't be fooled. This item contains no stencil. what you recieve is a tiny bottle of eucalyptus oil, and a sheet of copier paper with pictures of these designs on it. Why it is called a stencil I will never know. Dont pay $5 for a sheet of copier paper."

0,Only for beginners.,This book take a long time to arrive at any substance on Schemas and is only good for total novices to world of XML Schemas. In-fact the real schema is seen only half way through the book. It definitely is a boring read.
1,Great CD,I love ths CD I didn't know a lot about William Grant Still but I am glad I found him and I love his music
1,Perfect for cycling in cold weather but not one-size-fits-all,"I bought these glasses to keep cold air from blowing on my eyes while riding my bike to work in the morning. Sure they look a little funny, but not as funny as ski goggles or running into something because my eyes are watering so bad I can't see it.The foam makes a good seal and is thick enough that my eyelashes don't hit the inside of the lenses. The only problem is that the ear pieces are make for someone with an enormous head. When the lenses and foam are positioned correctly on my face, the curved part of the ear pieces is about and inch above and behind my ears. So when I hit a bump or move my head in any way, they slide down my nose and I have to push them back into place. Adjustable earpieces would be a big improvement."
0,Quality not what I expected,I was not pleased with the quality for the price. Shirt just felt cheap! I ended up returning it!
0,Owner,This Dryer is extremely loud and the stand is to light to handle the force of air. Plus the Air is too strong for the dogs and upsetting to them !!! I would not recommend this dryer !!!!
1,Creation...,"I was always interested in learning about the universe and its creation. I finally found a book that discusses just that in chapter 3 entitled ""The Story of Creation."" The author first explains the story of creation according to different religions, then introduces a more complete and more logical explanation using new terms and ideas. Very interesting."

1,Classic Soul Redefined.,"Luther was still a young, hungry artist when this was issued 20 years ago and the difference between this Luther and the newer, refined, updated Luther is the passion and fire in his delivery. The Vandross of 1982 was still perfecting his chops and wasn't afraid to reach for notes, excercise restraint and subltety and stretch a song out to an almost painful length. While it contains less than 10 tracks, ""Forever...."" has an epic feel to it. Elegant tracks like the title song and the beautiful, flawless ""Promise Me"" lend the LP it's grace and sophistication, while the opener, ""Bad Boy (Havin' A Party)"" sets a happy mood from the start. This was produced in the early 80's just as disco was on it's last legs, but for an album released in that era it bears none of the embarrassing sounds and pretentions that mars most music from early in the decade. This is the second in a line of classic ""Early Luther"" albums that are still essential listening."
0,not sure what to make of this one,"As a motorcyclist and adventure tourer, I had hopes for this book. I find it poorly written, tedious, unfocused. What to call it? It's not detailed enough to be travel writing, not deep enough for journal writing, not engaging in the least. The people and places are two dimensional and boring, and even the author's attempts to describe 'living hell"" come across as ""living heck."" I find myself not caring what happens to the author and his traveling companion, nor would I want to visit any of the places that he describes, though I'm willing to believe that they could actually be interesting outside of the author's stewardship.There are many good motorcycle adventure books (The Long Journey Home, Ten Years On Two Wheels, Chasing Che) to be had. This is not one of them."
1,Stop Shopping,"Don't bother looking any further for a guide, Bradt outdoes them all. Zanzibar, while extremely laid-back and peaceful can be a bit complex, if only because it's on the other side of the planet (for 99% of the world, anyway). The author does a fantastic job of explaining the nuances, accurately rating and describing the various tourist facilities, and helping to acclimate the reader before arrival (He's also not too shy to review his own book, I see). I've had two Bradt guides, and each time I've purchased the same guide from another publisher....each time I've ended up discarding the other in favor of the Bradt. Don't waste your money...."
1,A very intense thriller,"""Ghajini"" is a very intense thriller. The hero's fiancée is killed by mobsters. The hero suffers brain damage from the attack and can only remember the last fifteen minutes. He constantly makes notes to himself as he tracks down the mobster. The hero is played by Aamir Khan who starred as the kind nice teacher in ""Taare Zameen Par,"" which also he directed. The movie is well done, but violent. Not your typically Bollywood movie."
1,Just Awesome! BUT watch out for Xlyphone stick (UPDATED 2008),"My mom bought this for my son at 18 months and he LOVES it. The entire set is excellent quality and comes in a nice wooden crate (we use the crate for arts & crafts). My son is now a very accomplished Harmonica & flute player (he's now only 19 months) - he can't get enough of these instruments. One thing to look out for though -- the tip of the stick that you use for the xlyphone came off and I found my son eating it - it is definitely a choking hazard - I just took the stick away and tossed it in the garbage and he uses one of the other thick wooden sticks to play the xylophone and he hasn't missed a beat!****UPDATE**** 5/8/08It is now almost 3 years later and my son still plays with all of the instruments in this set. Looking back at all the toys we bought or he received as gifts, this is still one of his favorites and has helped foster his interest in music. I STILL highly recommend this set!!"
1,Excellenty Mystery,I was a captive audience in this wonderful mystery! The author cleverly guides her reader on a Mexican adventure through the eyes of a young girl as she discovers the truth about her amulet and the trials and tribulations of living in a mobile family. The story brought back a few memories for me of the feelings associated with moving to different schools. I recommend this book for anyone who loves a good mystery or wants to know what it's like to move many times.
0,Good but lacking details,"The book is better than other ATL titles. I found the book to be lacking in technical details - the author was obviously rushed. I had to read a lot of the ATL code to figure out how aggregation worked, for example. I appreciated the excellent detail-rich coverage of connection points. Unfortunately, there is little to no coverage of non-MFC lightweight windowing classes. Not a book for beginners as a lot of the technical details are left for the reader to discover on his/her own."
1,Life changing book for the beginning Zen practitioner.,This book was one of the first that I read on Zen. It really helped me to cope just after a bout with cancer. It helped me to understand and accept the unchanging universe and to appreciate what I still have--life.
0,"Kind of flimsy, eh","I like the form factor, I like how eazy the blade comes is unprotected, protected. But I'm not sure it really does that great of a job, I bought it for the wife to cut down boxes (we buy way too much through Amazon),and she really doesn't like it.It is probably a great hobby blade, scrapbooking etc, but for heavier around the house tasks, eh.."
0,Monster Blood II,"Not a bad sequel to the inital Monster Blood that I loved. Stine gave a few surprises, but basically it's a threadbare rehash, if you know what I mean. Monster Blood III is slightly better."
0,Alaska Women Write,"Pretty simplified written book, but if you want more real life writings from women who live in Alaska, not bad."
0,Please get on with it,"I have valiantly tried to slog my way through this series.I will often read a book that bores me just because I feel compelled to finish.10 books. Same story line over and over and over and over and....Other reviewers have accused we naysayers of short attention spans and a lack of intelligence.A true lack of intelligence would be if I wasted one more penny or second of my life on this trite, never-ending story.In my last review I campared him to Dean Koontz.I realized later that was a mistake.At least Koontz is entertaining."
0,Disappointed,"Had waited and waited for another Marion Zimmer Bradley but have been sorely disappointed with this latest release. Unlike her other Avalon books, I found this extremely slow moving. I actually had to re-read parts as my mind drifted from boredom.The magic, mystery and excitement were missing. I will miss Marion."
0,Thumbs down.,"We purchased this product for our grandson it didnt last 15 minutes before the on /off switch malfunctioned. it sounds like it has a short circuit. When operating this product the ""rapid fire"" cannot operate as advertised due to lack of air pressure causing a miss fire and the darts jam up into the gun barrel and tearing the suction cups off the darts. The battery compartment door screw was stripped for the start."
1,Lee's Are Still Well Made,Surprised me at this price. Lee Jeans are still well made and wear well. Double Black is really black but to maintain it you'll have to wash them in cold water. I dry them on medium...tho low is recommended...and they haven't shrunk as yet. They fit great and my posterior looks trim and fit (and isn't that what it's all about). For the price you won't find this quality elsewhere.
0,Lousy,".... Messy, inconsistent and really difficult to work with. It is unable to handle any impurities in the oil (such as garlic or pepper bits) since they will clog the spray nozzle making it a ($) non-recyclable garbage item. The way to go would be a basting brush and a small shallow bowl to mix the oil and other spices together. Stay away from Misto!"
1,"Awesome, can't wait for a sequel!","I purchased this book 4 days ago and my 3 children (5, 9 and 11) haven't put it down. They keep finding more and more look a likes everytime they open the book. It's brought them closer together also by sharing with eachother what they found. I'm hoping Joan Steiner will write a sequel."
1,No Plastic,"We live in an old brick building with charm, high ceilings and no AC. Qaulity fans are important to us, and the Hunter 90122 Centruy 17-Inch fits the bill. It is substantial, operates with minimum noise and has an appropriatly heavy cast iron base. And yes, I'm serious, there are no plastic components (Except for the device for setting the fan height). Turn off your AC, open your windows, turn on your Hunter and go green."
0,Good design but poor quality control.,"I agree with the positive reviews here in that it is actually wide enough for what you need. The durability however is somewhat suspect. I purchased this in September and was initially happy with it but after only 4 months the handle broke off. It wasn't dropped or damaged in any way. The handle just fell off. I would assume its a problem with it not being welded on properly but thats a strong lack of quality control.Unfortunately, this product is ""made in china for norpro"" which means the company has a good design but the factory that produces this is has spotty quality. The system they operate under means the actual manufacturer is never disclosed. If you want this product I recommend doing a thorough test of it after purchase and return if there's any kind of issue."
0,Mr. Carpenters worst yet!,"It really hurts me to write this review, since there is no way that i can say anything positive about this movie. I have been a fan of John Carpenter ever since Halloween, and didnt think i would ever watch a bad movie made by him, but here it is. The story is thin, the actors awful and the directorial job nonexistent. This is not a ""fun"" b-movie like Prince of darkness or Village of the damned, just a plain bad movie.I will give it two stars: One for the movie, and one for old friendships sake. Better luck next time Mr Carpenter!"
1,nice cover,We are using this for a George Foreman grill and it fits nicely. I don't yet know how well it will wear.
0,Big disapointment,"I ordered one of these Garden Owls some time ago.It seems that they have a batch of bad Owls audio wise.They don't hoot!I sent the first one back and recieved a replacement with no problem.It wouldn't hoot either! I called you folks about it and you suggested that I call the company that makes them. I did and they were very nice about it. They sent me another owl about a month ago and it worked great up until 3 days ago and then it quit hooting too!I've gave up on these Owls although the people were very good about replacing them! I've haven't bothered to call anyone about this last owl yet, don't think that the product is any good!"

As jazz critic Friedwald has pointed out, even when she hired jazz arranger Nelson Riddle to arrange for her, it only made her sound taht much more ametueristic.

1,"Real deal, very bright","Received what appears to be a real LRI Photon II in the real retail packaging. Ordered 1/3/2013, received 1/7/2013.Very bright, rivals my Arc AAA-P in a much smaller size. No problem adding this to keychain EDC! The included clip is very strongBeware fake/knockoffs. Look for textured button, clear on/off switch, retail packaging, and product stamping on the bottom.As long as you get a real one it should be awesome!"

1,Saturday night is Horror night,For a lot of us movie night is no longer in the budget. Besides you paid a fortune for that 100 inch TV.A Dracula fanfest starring the 2nd. best Dracula of all time Christopher Lee and Peter Cushing as Dr. Van Helsing.See also Blacula (Dracula's soul brother) Count Yorga vampire and David Peele in the Brides of Dracula.
0,BURNING BRIDGES,"I like the cartoon, KUDZU, by Doug Marlette, but was deeply disappointed in his first novel, THE BRIDGE. The story of Pick Cantrell's journey to self-knowledge is littered with characters too dim or cartoonish to take seriously, much less care about. Pick, himself, errs on the sociopathic, and seems to deserve the contempt heaped upon him by his adversaries. It's as if the author was searching for a platform to air his numerous grievances, and I feel as if I was hoodwinked into complicity by the over-generous cover blurbs. What parades as truth reads more like the sputtering complaints of a guy at odds with himself and the world. There are far better books out there, and despite the dubious recommendation of Marlette's self-proclaimed ""blood brother"" Pat Conroy, this is not the best book to come out of the South since ""Look Homeward, Angel"". ""God's Little Acre"" might be a better baseline."
0,B-,"The IMDB site currently shows a rating of '3.1' for this film, which is about what it deserves. The only value I could find was in Cynthia Thompson as the cave girl, Eba. Her raw beauty and innocence reminds me of the lead girl in other, far better films, such as One Million years B.C. and The Time Machine (1960). I mean really, there's nothing to like about the protagonist. With that ridiculous hat and tie, he's like a big doofus version of a young Indiana Jones, trying to act as if he's in a ROTN film. I'm not saying I don't like this film, just that it doesn't offer much in terms of the main character or story, when compared with other B-level movies. I'll probably hang onto it, for the sake of it's 80's appeal and for Cynthia, but I was really hoping for more."
0,Memoir of a former hippie with a mother complex,"After enjoying the author's witty restaurant reviews, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Aside from some wonderful descriptions (particularly ""the old, cold taste of olives""), this book is rife with '60s flower child attitude. Mostly tiresome and definitely cliche (all RIGHT, we get the idea the author isn't racially biased), the post-mortem attacks on the author's mother seem unnecessary and distracting. I'll stick with M.F.K. Fischer."
1,Becoming Conscious,"The Secret is actually a culmination/summation of what I have believed for years. It takes time to become conscious and The Secret is a mass media way to show a large audience what consciousness or the Law of Attraction is and makes it palatable. If you read the book over and over, take right action, speak and beleive the mantras, live in gratitude, praise and bless, and live in the present moment then this stuff works."
1,Forgotten Gem,"I had this album as a cassette when I was in high school. I loved it then and still love it. The songs are the perfect blend of pop and early 90's synth, straight from Britain."
1,Fabulous book,"This is a fabulous book for chronic ""nice people"" - even people who don't think they're ""nice."" It addresses victim mentality, saying yes when one means no, pleasing without being pleased, and much more. It is a great read for anyone who has mommy issues and/or has had his or her share of unfulfilling relationships/friendships - or the one who is with the ""nice person."""

1,HARRY POTTER ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,Harry potter and The Order of The Pheonix is the best book i have read this summer it is pack full of unexpected happenings like the death of someone (i will not say who) a love interest and a love intrest gone bad. Even if you don't like to read books you will want to read this one. I cant wait to see the movie.
0,Not as good as it sounds...,"This book left me disappointed and bored. There isn't enough depth covered in an artist's world, and the characters and interactions were flat. It started out strong at the beginning, but there is way too much filler in the part of the book where Alessandra grows up. The only interesting parts were the very beginning, when she is old and dying, and when she gets married. That is it."
0,okay but not that great!,My husband bought the DVD the minute it was on the store shelves because he said the reviews were good! We watched it and we both find it slow and dragging! The only reason I think he (Bill Murray) was nominated for the movie is because this is not his typical genre! Now I wish we just borrowed the DVD instead of spending $19.99 for it which I think will just be LOST IN STORAGE!
1,The Prefect Game,"I got this game a year ago seeing the commercials on TV. i was gonna get both but didn't cuz I wanted one challenge at a time. I started playing it then couldn't stop for 8 hours straight. I got pretty far in a couple of months but I am now stuck on the 6th dungeon. (theres 8 in all) i don't care cuz it makes me love it even more. it has awesome graphics, sound and challenges. I suggest this game to anyone and EVERYONE with a Game Boy."

0,Pity Guatemala,"It shows that the book was written by a missionary, although the author tries to hide it. While he talks to many people, he does not really seem to understand them. He lives with fear, because it is new to him. He is upset when refrigerator and TV do not run around the clock. He never really immerses himself into local living, just visits it. He does not really bring anything new to our knowledge"
0,horrible movie,THis movie was aweful. I don't expect oscar caliber performances from zombie movies just zombies in more than the last 20 minutes of the movie.
0,All the flavors of the farmer's market...if your farmer harvests only sugar...,"These types of fruit mixes live or die on the basis of how well the flavors in the package complement one another. The best of these kinds of things mix sweet fruit with sour or salty or chocolate or something else.Not this one. It's just cloyingly sweet on top of cloyingly sweet. There are several types of dried fruit in the bag, but there's so much added suger they all taste the same. Basically, everything is a little sweeter than normal raisins. This may appeal to the kids in your house, but the adults will want to approach this stuff with caution. You might be able to make this stuff edible by mixing it yourself with other (less sweet) things, but taken as-is you'll probably consider this mix to be almost inedible in anything but modest amounts."

Then I read the book and found that Charles Frazier had set the town of Cold Mountain right where I was born. One of my favorite songs on the soundtrack was ""I'm Going Home"". I've tried to research it, to find out who wrote it originally, but I've come up with nothing. If anyone could help me out here, I'd greatly appreciate it."
0,Would not buy it,I bought this product after reading the reviews and was very disappointed. Its power didnt last more than 20-30 mins even after charging it all the time.The most irritating factor was the dirt falling off from it while lifting it or even while placing it on its stand/Charger. I would definitely not recommend it and I am returning my vacuum cleaner.
0,I'd rather watch paint dry or grass grow,"I hate to join the choir, as it were, but I have to agree-this book is a humungous letdown, especially seeing that it comes from the Moxley expert and such a big publishing house. Can any semi-celebrity just publish tripe these days? I started this book convinced that more than one assassin did in JFK and I ended the book still believing---knowing---the very same thing. Publisher's Weekly got it right (for a change): use this book as a doorstop...as long is it is a single door, not a double door (ouch). What's next---""THE EARTH IS REALLY FLAT"" BY O.J. SIMPSON????????????????????????????Brian Craig"

1,"If you loved the film, this is the one to buy!","Those of us who love the show may find the film soundtrack a little slick for our tastes but individual taste aside, how can you argue with popularity of this dimension. You can't go wrong with this version but the intimacy of the original stage production is hard to beat."
0,Not Worth The Time,"Angels and Demons would be a wonderful book if Dan Brown could write. The premise is compelling, the anagrams are fascinating, the science presented is interesting.The problem is that the pace is off, the characters too easily solve the puzzles(no new information has been presented about the current conundrum, but somehow, the answer that has elluded our imminent symbologist heretofore suddenly pops into his brain--just in the nick of time to avoid death and destruction. That scenario is believable one time, but Dan Brown does it again and again.), and the attacks on the church eventually began to annoy this reader.I was hoping for an intelligent thriller...instead, I got a book that just couldn't deliver. Umberto Eco and even Michael Connelly are much more worthwhile authors."
1,AT LAST !,"If you have ever tried understanding the Book OF Thoth and like me became frustrated, this book is for you. This book explains in plain language the meaning behind the sometimes veiled unintelligible writings of Aleister Crowley. Unless you are well versed in the language of the Kabbalah, Geometra. Egyptian magick to the extream this book is a God send. You won't be disappointed. Some Knowledge of Crowleyanity I would say is necessary for full enjoyment. Recommended."
1,I like it but......,"I received this as a gift and thought it was the best travel coffee mug ever made. Until, that is, I gave it a ""thorough"" cleaning. Although I'd clean the mug and lid after each use with liquid detergent, I discovered that the lid required a much more extensive cleaning. I was so grossed out to discover how much black gunk collects inside the lid. Cleaning the lid is really difficult/time consuming. I became concerned about the health ramifications. I added dilluted bleach to the lid and let it sit overnight. However, the bleach smell lingered and I found myself not wanting to drink from it. The bleach odor eventually aired out. I currently use baking soda with white vinegar. The two ingredients foam when combined. I still used a long bristled brush to ensure that everything is removed."
1,Good Tool,"I bought this to replace a microplane that had a rubber handle that broke off. I use this mostly to grate ginger root and it does the job quickly. The blades are very sharp and zests lemon peel into a fluffy pile in no time. I took one star off because when I took it out of the dish washer, it had a bit of rust near the handle. Other than that, no problems."

I washed it very well and used it again, filling it a little higher this time. The discoloration was bad, but not quite as bad - you could see both lines. After calling the company and being told I should return it to the ""store"", I went online and Amazon immediately sent me the shipping label and it was returned for free. I love Amazon. I would not buy this again. Now I have to find a proper pot for keeping water hot for a whole day."

1,yey! finally,"i bought in 2004 the 1st season and now, they second season is out. i am so happy! i enjoyed the first season so much, and now i will probbly enjoy the second. what do you think?"
0,EPIC FAIL! NNNooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!!!!!!!!!,"There have already been some excelent reviews written in the 1 Star section that I have neither the energy or motivation to emulate. Compare the 1 Star reviews to those who gave it 5 Stars (""Star Wars is Cool!"") and you will see who the real fans are.Lucasfilm has once again slapped the fans in the face. The changed Krayt dragon call, the pink Lightsaber and worse of all the Darth Vader screaming Noooooooo!!!!!!!!!!! is pathetic. Oh, by the way... it seems that the HUGE outcry from Fans for the past 15 years over the Greedo / Han incident meant nothing to Lucas. Yes, Greedo STILL Shoots first!So George, keep your Cash Cow to yourself. I Cancelled my pre-order."
0,We've heard it again and again. It's time for some change.,"FIVE is what I call an average CD. Since there are so many other boy groups that sound exactly like them, they're no different. Backstreet Boys, N'Sync, Kai.. We've heard them and personally, I'm sick of them. It's the same, sappy lyrics and the melody is like one of those annoying ones which you can't get out of your head."
0,Too grainy and Robert Conrad cannot carry a picture.,"TV on 1950 looked better than this product, plus the first parts feature the boring Robert Conrad (Wild Wild West fame) and he does not make it as a French-Canadian trapper."
1,Great!,"The front and back cover art of this book is the best part! Most of the art inside is awesome, while some of it is pretty average. Overall, it's a great art book with lots of high quality pictures. Although I would like a little less ""Beast Wars,"" and a little ""More Than Meets the Eye,"" I can't complain, because I knew what I was buying. Good buy for any true Transformers fan."
1,The best adventure ever,THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!! J.R.R. Tolkien has a magnificent way of writing books for all ages to read!
0,Twilight In Texas,"$13.68 for a USED PAPERBACK plus S&H;?????? REALLY??????????????? This is the only Jodi Thomas book not on Kindle. WHY???I rated this one star ONLY because it's $13.68 for a USED PAPERBACK plus S&H.; I haven't had the pleasure of actually READING this book yet, nor will I pay the outrageous asking price of a USED PAPERBACK!"
0,BEWARE OF THIS SYSTEM RESOURCE PIG!!!!,"I kid you not, this suite,program,resource *THUG* IS THE WORST GARBAGE ON THE MARKET. Like others i read the shiny reviews and took a chance and purchasing it because of the frequent trips to HELL I had logged in with other so called ""SECURITY SUITES"" over the years. Works ok for about the first month or so and then...WHAMMMM..crash city. Think I'm joking...buy it and find out for yourself. I'm no PRO yet, but i do have enough knowledge about programming to know when my PC goes from( NORMAL to CHOKE) out of the clear blue. Uinstalled it (3X) just to make sure that it was the cause of the problem,sure enough,it was. Other reviewers mentioned thier processor being pulled to the grind...well it's true. STAY AWAY...STAY FAR..FAR..AWAY."
1,from a BSF member,eventhough this is not the niv that we use for BSF i had found it is great companion for my bible study. i think BSF commentaries and notes are the best and this bible commentaries almost always align with my BSF notes.i love it and i would recommend it
1,Well loved by my children,"I thought that this was a creepy looking book when I bought it. But since I had it, I decided to let my kiddos look at it and see if they liked it. They Did!!My three year old, who wants to read, had no problem 'reading' this story and finding out all sorts of interesting aspects to the pictures as he read the book.My son has bullied his little sister into helping him act out this little book. He has 'read' it to me many times over. He has enjoyed this book and so has my daughter.I rated it a four because, as I said, I found the pictures just a bit creepy when we first got the book. But it is well enjoyed by children, so I'd certainly buy it again.Enjoy."
0,Game Would Not Run on Win XP Pro,"I would love to have played this game, but was very dissapointed when it would not play on my XP-Pro System, which has top of the range sound and graphics cards. Total waste of money. If I could give it a zero rating, I would."
1,on the top,this book is one ofthe best books I have ever read in rhinoplasty.the companion CD-ROM is amazing tool.
1,Tequila Sunrise,"Tequila Sunrise proves to be a quick read. Nate Rose takes on seven cases each involving women, and he proves that he will do what ever it takes for them. Michael Bracken weaves the stories together with secondary characters that keep popping up from story to story. All the stories were good and there were even some suprise endings."
0,"""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately.""","I have not yet used this product, so my 2 star rating has nothing to do with the quality of the product (since I am unable to rate it that way yet). But imagine my surprise when my shipment arrives, and I find that the paper insert in the cake pan states ""Requires Decorator Preferred Heating Core, sold separately."" Nowhere in the item description did it state that when I purchased this item, otherwise I would have ordered one then!! Now I have to wait for yet another order to arrive before I can use this... AND pay for extra shipping. Fabulous. Thanks a lot, Amazon.com!"
1,Speakers,"Good looking speakers, except the speaker wires are too short. Using on my desktop computer unable to use volume adjustment unit that came with the speakers; luckily you can adjust the volume through the computer. Sound is good. The bass adjustment is inconveniently located on the back of the subwoofer. Overall I would recommend these speakers. Very good for the price."
1,A solid sequel to a classic,"It is always difficult to make a sequel to a classic film, especially if you do so a decade or more later. This becomes next to impossible if it is a film that is based on a novel or series of novels. Most people know of the original Wizard of Oz film, but most are unaware that it is all based on a series of books. This film is a solid effort to keep to the books, while also paying homage to the original film. This is one of the first films Disney did in the live action area, and it is a solid effort. Fairuza Balk is well casted as Dorothy, and the work by Lucas and Henson in the film is top notch. This is a great film to have, be it for your kids or for your personal collection."
0,Full of Statistics?,"If you want to know all of the numbers of F1 they are here. Unfortunately, there are no curcuit maps, no information of nationalities of drivers and the statistics end in 1997. As well, there are mistakes in the information. For a statistical book this is something I can't forgive. I spotted many errors and that is just things I know (come on Michael Schumacher driving a Ferrari in 1994!). It makes me wonder what else is wrong."
0,"A waste of time, money, ink and paper","A poor excuse for journalism - Mr. Tapper should keep to telling the story without the colorful references to ""Bushies"", ""Gorbies"" and his grating personal observances of figures central to the issue. I thought the penchant for shock chapter titles and petty personalizations fell by the wayside in 8th-grade creative writing, but sadly that is apparently not the case.I tried to read this book - I knew it had to get better... By page 200 it was in the rubbish can."
0,horro movie?,"I saw this movie last night; please.. is this a horror movie? I never understood the idea; as a horror movie fan, I think movies like this one must be destroyed!!!!! I am sorry to say that... but is the truth."
1,great cd,this is the best cd i own. i listen to this cd all the time iv had it in my cd player for a month now and i am still not tired of it. it has everything from screamo to emo on it so if your a fan of that kind of music you should definately check it out.
1,It's a guilty pleasure!,"When i was little, i watched this movie NON stop. I know all the words to the songs! They are cheesy & it's NOT the best script but it's still a movie that i will always remember & will always enjoy. It's NOT grease 1 but that's what i like about it (although, grease is a classic and always will be). Regardless of that, i am happy to have just ordered it & plan on watching it real soon...I may even sing to the songs haha. But it's a good movie for those who are NOT critics. If you like movies that are cheesy, then you will like this. Everybody has different tastes, so some people will not like this movie."
1,Really works forearm,I keep this in my car and work my forearms while sitting in traffic. Portable and works front and back.
0,Boring Legal Mush,"There is one thing you can't call Author John Grisham, and the word is ""original."" Book after book, made into a legal ""thriller"" that is supposed to entertain us. Some of his stories were good, like ""The Client."" But this movie is not as great. It is way too long (2 and a half hours) and tends to drag on at the end. The story has a conflict, but no substance because it seems that the conflict in this story is an empty threat that never evloves to anything. Even though the characters go through heated emotions, it is hard to relate or care about them. Not Reccomended."
0,Predictable,"As is all too common with movies this one offers slick hype, but with little substance. I found myself ""seeing"" the next scene and the movie's conclusion before each occurred. A real yawner."
0,Too tight,"I remember how excited i was when i ordered this pumps, but imagine my disappointment when i received and tried it on and realized that i couldn't hardly stand in them for a long time because,it was just too tight. I tried to force myself to wear them and walk around in the hopes of breaking into them. It just never loosened up, so i gave it away. Maybe it was just this shoe, because i have another Two Lips sandal and it doesn't hurt my feet at all."
1,The Man Who Realized His Dream,"A fun, historical account of an early western themed amusement park. Written by its founder, Arthur L. Bensen. It's the story of Frontier Town, North Hudson, NY in the Adirondack Mountains, located between Lake George and Lake Placid. Its filled with many early photos and the text was written by the founder of the park. It was written in the 1970's. 130 pages. It tells how it all began and why, where and how it was built. Its no longer open but is the place of happy childhood memories for thousands of us that were lucky enough to visit. If you enjoyed Frontier Town, this book will not only bring back memories of a gentler time but give you a look into the dream that one man had. He went against all of the odds to make his dream come true."
1,Biography of a Pioneering Feminist,"I first became aware of this remarkable woman 60 years ago upon seeing the 1945 technicolor film ""A Song To Remember"", about the Polish pianist Frederic Chopin and his infamous mistress who wrote under the pen name of George Sand. Dozens of biographies have been written about her (many sensationalized) but my favorite for both style and substance has been than of Andei Maurois titled ""Lelia: The Life of George Sand"". This is the true story of a royal bastard who became a celebrated novelist and early feminist, winning the right of women to inherit property and helping promote the concept of ""Women's Suffrage"" in England and the U.S. I've owned an original hardcover edition for years and marvel at your ability to own your own copy at such a bargain price. Go for it!"
0,I can't even get through it!,"Don't get me wrong, I absolutely inhaled the other books in this series. Like others, I am bogged down with characters who are going nowhere, and the book just doesn't have the plot to grab the reader like they have in the past.Sorry, but this book is a yawn, no matter how many pages it has. I will persevere and try to finish it-eek, have never said THAT about a DG book before! Usually I ignore my family and just hunker down and read 24/7! I hope this is not going to be the new standard for the rest of her books in the Outlander series. I was very dissapointed."
0,Not a fan,"Abby is spunky and loving and a mother we all wish we had. I really enjoyed getting to know the characters, especially the family. Unfortunately that is where the ""like"" about this book ends. I was a bit disappointed at the abruptness of the ending especially having so many loose ends left. The whole point of this story was that Dylan was there to write a book, yet the story ends with no book. Being left with nothing by the mother in law, seems to be that should have been resolved as well, especially for the children. I don't see the second book in my future."
0,You can pass this one safely,"I got about halfway through the book, when I just couldn't get on. Why? It is unoriginal. Gob'lin please no. Writing shows no special style. If you want to read fantasy, go get George R.R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire. Or even Goodkind's Sword of Truth, brutal though it is, Goodkind at least has a gripping plot unlike this bad copy of Tolkien. If you have read any of those two authors you will be dissapointed with Jordan.I can't imagine anyone reading volume after volume of stuff like this."
0,"Looks fine, doesnt fit me",Try this on in a store. I ordered online and it is not comfortable. Runs more narrow. I won't try any Croc flats after this fiasco. Not adjustable.Think it is great for a 9B or 9M.I'm a wide and I did not like it.Still love crocs...
1,Nice,"Ever since I started looking up and listening to The Used, I've loved most of their music. This CD is no exception. They are one of my more favored bands. This music to me is enjoyable, leisure music, and that's what I do. I enjoy this music in my leisure. Nice."
1,Good product,"I also have many 35mm negatives sitting around in less than optimal storage conditions. These holders are my attempt to organize family memories and although these are not as stiff as I had hoped they get the job done. I just ordered a couple more, recommended"
1,"Simply the best book I've ever read, The greatest!","If it was my choice everyone would get a copy of this book to enjoy. Its good for preteens and teens alike. It is more for girls then boys. I am very picky about the books that I read. I couldn't put the book down. I loved it.It is about a girl named Ella, who is cursed by a foolish fairy spell. The spell is that she obedient and has to follow every command, if she doesn't follow she will start to cramp and choke and suffer the consequences. It is a twisted tale of Cinderella that all will enjoy. You'll see what I mean at the end. At first I didn't like the movie Cinderella, but this book gake it a whole new meaning. By the end you'll wish you were Ella."
0,wiper wont fit,"even though your site says this wiper will fit my make and model,WRONG!! over half the cost to return What a scam!"
0,She loved a serial killer,"I can't read a book written by someone who admired and respected a known murderer, William Edward Hickman. He was a man without morals, without conscience, perfect for todays CEO's."
1,Making 'The Wizard of Oz'.,"A great little gem surrounding the making of one of the great movies. It is fictional, to be sure. A tour de force, laugh fest starring Chevy Chase and Carrie Fisher, along with assorted munchkins and japanese tourists. I laughed till I cried."
0,Delivers less than promised,"Mr. Petroski labors at too much length to describe how several common items became what they are today as a result of the design process and subsequent evolution as a result of engineers' continual desires for improvment. This exercise is less successful than earlier works which focused on the engineering process and used infrastructure projects such as buildings and bridges for examples.Lay readers, and even engineers, would be better served by reading ""Remaking the World"" or ""To Engineer Is Human"" which provide more insight into the engineering process and which are more relevant and connected to the common structures and objects that we take for granted every day."
0,Totally useless Index! Pain in behind.,"Totally useless four page Index. Poor organization. Making it virtually impossible to navigate. Impossible to look up anything in this book. You'd have to read it cover to cover and hope that what you're most interested in pops up. After reading the reviews here I was disappointment to say the least.Nothing, that I could find, on progesterone/re: growth of uterine fibroids, endometriosis, muscle loss/age, testosterone/insulin resistance....and on.Needed more on ""Myths and Misunderstandings about Side Effects"""
0,so now what do I do?,"Ok, so he's not that into me. I got the message. Now what? This is where I was hoping for answers, and just didn't get them. The book is funny and easy to read, but it doesn't give more in the area of what to do next. I wish it did."
1,Gladiator is awesome,I saw this movie in the theater. It was really well done. It isn't what you expect. There are quite a few of little twists. It is really excellent. Recommended viewing definitely.
0,Well-meaning...,"A rambling book that seems to be about a flawless Buddha looking for love at first sight. It is absolutely jammed with new-age generalities, grafting every ""being who is at peace with nature"" cliché into a cross-cultural version of the ancient character of Kokopelli (and making him tall, dark and handsome, to boot). The story is in great need of editing; it got tiresome to me in a short time and is way too long for a young child. That and the computer-generated drawings lean toward the commercial graphic end of things stand as than truly expressive, artistic illustration.Being a Californian, I am VERY familiar with new-age appropriation of a mythical Native American past and am not a fan of such depictions. If you have dream catchers, rainbow stained glass and vegan tendencies you wish to indoctrinate your children with, go for it."
1,Pleasantly surprised,"I jumped at the chance to purchase this cordless duo, especially for the excellent price (after rebate), and was pleasantly surprised at the features available. My only disappoinment was that the software CD was blank - NOTHING was on it - and that's the same thing that happened to me the last time I purchased a Logitech mouse. So just the annoyance of having to go online and find the correct drivers (which I still haven't as it keeps crashing) would be my only real complaint. I also wish there was more of an incline - the keyboard is too flat, even with the legs up, so my wrists hurt LOL"
1,oh wow,"i was never much into pro wrestling or things like that but i loved and love this book. you get so wrapped up and caught up in the incredibly great writing and story that you cant put it down. i would reccommend it to everyone, everyone can learn from this and enjoy it like i did. you have to read this book wrestling fan or not cause its about so much more than that:)"
0,poor quality,Sheets are scratchy (even after numerous fabric softener rinses) - very disapponting since the matching comforter set is so well made and adorable. Sheets are overpriced - definitely would not recommend.
0,A Choppy Chop film,"This movie felt very much like an armature investment, the problem is the Screen writer! lol, the actors lines are not fully developed, the story jumps in time, and never fill in the Choppy parts,"" when Elizabeth, or her other name, meets the News reporter who was killed 30 yrs ago, they meet his doing a story, on malpractice, suddenly "" Chop!"" they are talking about apparitions. just one issue. It could have worked as there are good moments and some very good actors strewn in an through the story line. The hilarious dialogue of the Killer. Brilliant."
0,one of the worse books I've struggled to read,"This book is pure new age semantic babble. this book is a waste of the paper it's printed on. It's an attepmt to market to a genre that is noted for high sales. ""EMPTY pages"" best describes this book."
1,perfect just what we wanted,Perfect just what we wanted sturdy with good lidsThey work well for salads and fruit and leftovers and stack just fine even when full
0,Not as good as Nunchucks,"If you have no weapons, I don't recommend Tuscan Milk. Instead, I recommend getting a set of nunchucks or a club. A broom stick or a brick are good too. If you can't find anything at all, you can buy the book Combat Without Weapons available on Amazon. Tuscan Milk does not work well as a weapon because it is hard to swing and difficult to throw. It also can't be used to stop any bullets. I read on a website that it can stop a knife, once. That's not really worth it to me. Unless you are attacked by cats, and need a distraction, you probably don't need Tuscan Milk. I wish someone had written a review like this before I bought the milk. I hope this review is helpful."
1,Pretty awesome!,"This movie is a great one with awesome special fx! This is a must see if you are big into a lot of movies you will definitely enjoy this one, if you are interested in a look at the end of days this one seems to look pretty accurate.. Anyways love it and is a good watch :)"
0,Huh?,"I won't bore anyone with another summary of this film's plot. I'll just give my pure opinion. Quite simply, I just don't understand why anyone would take the time to make this film. The fact that I watched the entire film once is amazing. I understand the plot. I just don't understand why anyone would put so much effort in to something so unnecessary. At one point I thought to myself, ""Perhaps I'm missing something. I need a second opinion."" I showed Dead or Alive 2 to a friend of mine who used to write film reviews. She couldn't even get through the first 30 minutes of the film before cutting it off. There you have it folks---This film is a clear waste of time."
0,Black & Heck...this can opener sucks!,"I bought this and immediately had problems with it. I thought I was getting a good deal, but I guess you get what you pay for sometimes. It was not catching to open the cans, then it peeled and shredded the paper around the top, and then when it was scraping the top of the can (because it wasn't opening it) it was filing off tiny bits of metal. And I don't know about you, but I don't want to feed that to anybody. Not even my con-artist sister-in-law. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because I called Black & Decker and they are replacing it for free. And when I told them that I just bought it they offered to pay for shipping as well."
1,Great for meditation and massage,"Some new age music can be monotonous or uncaptivating. This album is diverse, interesting and very relaxing. A tremendous CD for meditation, massage or just relaxation. I'd rate it a 5 in it's genre, a 4 in all genres."
0,"Great price, TERRIBLE packaging, be aware","My son got this for Christmas from his grandparents and although we are extremely grateful and the price on this is great, the way the discs are packaged is terrible. As others have stated, they do not come in individual cases or even slip cases, they are just positioned in a foam block. It is really difficult for my son to properly put them away himself, so I am worried that over time they will get left out and scratched.Be aware that if you want to keep them well protected, you will want to purchase jewel cases or at least sleeves separately. The foam block CAN be removed and the discs stored in jewel cases inside the toy box, which is what I'm guessing we'll end up doing.Can't complain about the price though, and it only took me about 5 minutes to get all the digital copies loaded into iTunes and onto the ipod, which is great."
1,Read This Book,"I met Micah through live journal and I knew I had to check out her writing as soon as she gave me the link because Micah is one of the smartest, sweetest people I know. And this book was one of the best romance novels I've ever read because Micah's tale is immensely realistic and jaded girls or people desperately clutching to the hope of love like I am love the heroine who's like me, someone whose fears and insecurities won't disappear the moment Mr. Right comes along. Its hard to take the leap of love but take the leap and buy this book because you'll be glad you did, and that's a promise definitely not worth breaking."
1,A triumph of a book about Mexico!,"This book is a triumph, filling a long-standing need for information about our Southern neighbor. Now more than ever, libraries, indviduals, researchers and scholars, as well as the general reader and travel-tourist would be wise to invest in this masterfully complete yet highly readable and acessible volume as soon as possible. Simply splendid and invaluable."
0,Disturbing,"After listening to this CD, I began to wonder how anyone at anytime could even survive listening to anthing this awful. Maybe if you're on drugs, this msic may inspire a good trip, but for anyone sane do not even contemplate purchasing this CD."
1,Simplicity and meaning for living,Rarely does one have the opportunity to share others pain and feel as though you are not intruding. This book bares all for many and the responses by the author are extradordianry and vital.
1,A New Respect for Pumpkins!,"I love all the characters--including the pumpkin Max. I particularly love Ellie's relationships with her dad and her grandmother and, of course, with Max. This is a fun book to read and now I've got to read all the rest of Ms. Bauer's books!"
0,Some Credibility Checks On An Active Imagination,"This young, obviously learned author has really ""pushed the envelope"" with his radically reductive explanations of human nature, and human behavior. Perhaps the time is ripe for an astute application of Sir Karl Popper's ""falsifiability criterion,"" in order to restore some balance to an otherwise very creative account; for while creativity and imagination are essential to the advancement of science (or any other human endeavor), so is rigor. On the humorous side, I don't recommend that ""dashing young suitors"" share the underlying philosophy of human beings contained in this book with their favorite girlfriend--even if they privately believe it. Otherwise, they may find themselves ""standing in the rain"" and, literally, out of the gene pool. The ""Queen of Hearts"" can surely see and will usually prefer a heart in her ""Gentleman."" And it's still true that the heart knows things that reason (or scientistic materialism) knows nothing about (Blaise Pascal)."
0,sorry i purchased in ignorance,realized that ph up and ph down -are not anything but temporary fixes; the real need is to cycle a aquarium and work with it with water changes or water from a reverse osmosis source in the first place-not mess with the chemicals which at best are a cover up and don't last long and really hurt the fish more than it seems they help. sorry I purchased
0,"Ug, me not like!","I seem to be in the minority in not liking this book at all, I was highly impressed by the likes of Jurassic Park and The Lost World, but this book seems to have all the same pitfalls of those with non of the pluses. The technological detail was highly boring (as with JP), I do love imaginative technology in sci-fi, like 2001 for instance, but that is seemlessly coupled with a thrilling story, this is like a textbook in places. As with all Michael Chriton books I have read, the characterisation is weak to non-existant, and unfortunately the storyline isn't elaborated enough to make it interesting. The huge potential of these apes, a relic of a brutal past civilisation is squandered in favour of a cheap horror thrill. I would not recommend this book"
0,Still waiting for this book,Well it has now passed a month since buying this book on Dec 14 and has still not arrived!Ok it has been holidays so I really hope it will arrive soon./Peter
0,Cute but break easy,The purple isn't that dark....I was disappointed that it was lighter in color. I had it for about two weeks and I was out with friends and hit my hand on the able and the ring shattered.
0,Wayyy overpriced,As of this date you can buy all the individual seasons for almostfifty dollars less than this 'collection' (which is just all the separateseason boxes).Always bugs me when they package a group of items and charge MOREthan it would cost to simply buy them separately

0,What a silly waste of time!,"The audience for Shaun the Sheep was clearly meant for children, but I thought the story lines were puerile, and I was embarrassed to give it as a gift to my young granddaughters."
1,Life with Father (by Clarence Day),"I loved this book as a preteen and I loved it, and the sequel ""Life with Mother"" too. Mr. Day paints an accurate picture of life in the early 1900's for a middle class family. Yes, his father is rude and a bit obnoxious, but watching him is very funny. He loved his wife and family and while he blustered and yelled, they loved him. I enjoyed this book and thought it was great."
1,Totally Kewl!!!,"I must say, this is by far the best Prodigy disk out there. I think I've listened to it so much that the laser on my CD Player is burning through my disk!!! Awsome Techno music. If you like this one, you'll love Fat of the Land, and Gilted Generation. If you like techno, then you MUST get this disk. It kicks!!!"
1,One of Toni's best!,"Track List:----------1. You Mean The World To Me (Radio Edit) 4:002. You Mean The World To Me (Radio Edit Remix) 4:113. You Mean The World To Me (Extended Mix) 5:324. Seven Whole Days (Live) 6:15Another classic Reid/Babyface/Simmons production here! Toni's sultry and seductive vocals keep you in a trance while you listen. I love this single because it not only contains the radio remix I would hear often back in the 90's of this hit single, but it also has a fantastic version of ""Seven Whole Days"" recorded live at LaCoCoCabana in Atlanta, Georgia. I never had the pleasure of seeing Toni in concert but she sounds so AMAZING live! I'd still love to see her!"
0,Even the title is a lie,"""How One Mother Rallied a Million Others Against the Gun Lobby""I can see that Miss Thomases and her organization are sticking with this lie about how they attracted 750,000 to their first rally on the Mall in Washington, DC. This number has been exposed as a lie long ago, yet Donna and her co-horts persist in repeating it.(...)>No way they got that many people! They're so much in the minority, that they feel the need to lie about their numbers."

0,buyer beware,"This unit has been discontinued by telpro inc. and has been replaced with a model 195 which is what you will receive if you order the 170lr. The problem is that you can buy the 195 model for $199 from telpro itself,instead of $399 from amazon for the same unit."
1,Lo mejor de lo mejor,"Un Cd obligado para aquellas personas que dicen ser fanaticos de los Stones, contiene lo mejor que hicieron los Stones al final de los 60's. Midnight Rambler es sencillamente magistral, muy mejorada en relacion a la version en estudio (nada mala por cierto), el solo de guitarra de Mick Taylor y Keith Richard en Sympathy for... nunca sono mejor. Ademas contiene rock 'n' roll en su mejor expresion (Carol y Little Queenie). Lo unico malo es que el disco ha debido ser doble!!¿No lo tienes?. ¿Que estas esperando?. Compralo!!!"

1,Great Read- very to the point and honest,"I liked reading Reingold's insight and his candor. I work for Smith Barney. So, I know the Grubman side of the story. Always thought Grubman was a ""piece of work"" and full of himself. This helped bring some light to his interactions with other analysts like Reingold. Great read. I think I finished it in about 2 hours as I couldn't put it down."
0,not durable,"my lab loved it, but the sling shot thing doesnt go very farit only lasted a day with my dog until it was in shredsjust use a tennis ball"
1,Meal Time,"After the entrance has been shut, Buu becomes hungry and creates his own escape route out of the time chamber. Upon escaping, Buu decides to eat all of the Z fighters and their families. Gotenks and Piccolo arrive too late to help. Even if all seems lost, Gohan is still undergoing his training in the world of the Kai's."

This book should be delivered no later than 9/30/08 and hasn't arrived yet. no money back and no book
1,Very informative book,"I think Meet the Stars of Sweet Valely High was very informational and tells fans all they wanted to know about their favorite actor/actress.It gives you information from what the stars fave foods are to who is their fave football team. It also includes great pics of the cast.I would suggest buying the book, only if you're an avid fan, because any other person wouldn't appreciate it the way die-hard fans would.And keep watching SVH!"
0,"Never could get this to work, probably my lack of knowledge","I should have taken it in to a Radio Shack or someoneto help me ""set it up"". I really think it is importantfor everyone to have a weather radio. Great price, butI just could not get it to work ! Gave it away, hopingthe person will figure it out, and put great use to it."
1,Wonderful !!!,"Gary's cd is Wonderful.I thought Gary's first cd would have 4 or 5 songs on it that you would like and then you would have to skip the rest.BUT no way this cd is wonderful.this is diffently a CD you can play from start to finish and not get bored.But if i had to pick just one track from the cd it would have to be track 3,say it all.That song is so truthful and say's it all.I know in Nova Scotia there may be a wait for the store's to restock the cd so if you have to buy online to get it do it. Trust me you wont be disapointed.Gary you did it.Now take a moument stop and enjoy it.We all can get a piece of your blessing from track 14.Thank You Lord. Yes And Thank you Gary."
0,A BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.........,"PETS IN PARADISE 2 IS A BIG LET DOWN.AFTER WATCHING THE SUPERB ORIGINAL PETS IN PARADISE, IEXPECTED THE FOLLOW UP TO BE AS GOOD, OR EVEN BETTER.THIS D.V.D HAS SEVERAL FAULTS.THE PICTURE IS NOT CLEAR (FILM LIKE APPERARANCE),NOT ENOUGH CHAPTERS, TOO EXPLICIT, TOO ""ARTY"",AND GENERALLY DOESN'T LOOK RIGHT.THIS IS ONE TO STAY AWAY FROM.IF YOU DON'T ALREADY OWN IT, BUY THE ORIGINAL.OTHERWISE, GET "" PET OF THE YEAR 2000"" OR"" PET OF THE YEAR 2001 PLAYOFF, OR "" PENTHOUSEGENTLEMAN'S CLUB ""YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED."
0,Not worth it!!!,"This is just another item that looks good on paper, but does not work.I followed the instructions and was able to see the time for a minute or so, then it died."
1,Spectacular!!!!!,"Yes! I Agree im waiting for the Natalia Osipova - Don Quixote, i think she's the best role for Kitri to light the stage on fire.And i also saw her Flames of Paris PDD in the youtube! well its a breathtaking performance. But for the meantime, i will enjoy this one, until they could release the Osipova - Don Q., anyway this DVD is also nice, Great leads and spectacular to watch!"
1,"Hands down, the best new invention since the PDA","You hear about these things but you never know until you take a chance.It changes you.Remember life before cell phones?That's how I see this product.I was laying down my options;MD,other mp3s,or should I continue burning CDs.This was not just a pricey hard drive that plays your music.It's an investment for anyone who is a lover of good music.It syncs with my computer just as good as a PDA.In fact, when I purchased my first PDA in 1999 it was about the same price as this iPod.The sound quality is nothing like a walkman.The amount of music this thing can hold is unfathomable to me right now.If you're thinking about,and you can afford it,you should try it.If it doesn't work you can give this product a low rating and sell it for more than you paid for on Ebay."
1,Nice for multi use,"I'm just starting to use the HP 12C, not a big fan of RPN, but then again that's what I bought it for.Nice thing is that for those calculations that don't require RPN you can change back to ""normal"" calculator function. The case was nice as was the instruction booklet that I carry around in my briefcase and have marked up quite a bit.Nice spot on the back to engrave your name.The only drawbacks are that the case does not much more than cover the calculator and gives a place to put in your business card to stake your claim to it. Would have liked to have had a possible ""extra battery"" compartment in the least, even though I have not had to change the battery yet."
1,C Batteries,"Is there really anything more you need to say? They are C batteries, fully charged ready to go in whatever you need."
0,So utterly terrible that I have to buy it.,"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Everything about it is horrible - acting, editing, plot, special effects (if you could even call them that), etc etc.Because of that, however, it's become a favorite with my group of friends. I've shown it to just about everyone I know and we all find it hilarious, so I'm buying it for one of my friends as a birthday present. I don't know. I suppose it has it's own special place in our heart in a ""so-bad-it's-good"" kind of way."
0,Too many changes,I have eagerly always awaited Scarpetta's new adventures. However I am severly disappointed in this latest book. First of all it feels like someone else is writing this book. The style is different and now the third person in just weird.Also the plot was soo weak. It took 95% of the book to take us nowhere and then a very hurried explanation at the end. The story was weak and the characthers so one dimensional (mainly Lucy)I hope she finds her way of writing again!
0,Well - that didn't work,I had high hopes for this one! Read once - nothing. Twice - nothing. Listened to both CDs several times - nothing All the information is regurgitated over and over. We've heard it all elsewhere too. I am just one. Try it if you like.
0,Magnetic screwdrivers for computers and gaming devices???,"I've always been told to use non-magnetic tools on computers and now that gaming systems have memory, the same rule would apply. So, unless you want to totally screw up (no pun intended) your computer/gaming system, do not use these screwdrivers on your computer or gaming system."
1,Fantastic Read!!,SURRENDER is a wonderful adventure and love story combined. The colonial American setting was refreshing and the romance was sizzling. I'll be sure to check out Pamela Clare's backlist.
1,Talkie But Fun,"Let me just say this right off, I am a die hard fan of independent films. I enjoy character driving movies rather then the big explosions and thin story lines of big budget hollywood films. This film was very entertaining and witty, but the people were never explored more then just the surface. I would recommend this movie anyway, if just to mavel at the clever dialogue between John Hamilton (Grover) and Chris Eigeman (Max)."
1,Very useful!,"I used this for amateur jewelry repair. Just keep it greased if you want it to last. I use wheel bearing grease in the shaft, because you might hear grinding noise when you bend it in certain areas."
1,music is awsome but sound quality is dissapointing,"this cd is an awsome cd if you are a peach head i love this cd but i recomend that you get this before you get fillmore so youm apreciate this more.mountain jam has a darker feel to it than on eat a peach.but beware on mountain jam duanes guitar fades in an out because the recording is bad,sometimes you cant even hear the music,but i still recomend this album because it is awsome dreams is better than the studio verson,the long lead guitar on this one is great,i really love dimples,especially when they end the song and start back up again,i have never heard such a better version of statesbouro blues it is a little bit longer than the one on fillmore and it rocks,i truly and honestly recomend this,just try and ignore the faulty sound quality."
0,Mask is cheap and flimsy,I thought this mask would be like the sturdy hard plastic ones ive seen elsewhere. It is just a cheap halloween mask type material.. Much like the clear plastic that comes as the backing for toys and action figures. Worst of all it has a hanging tab right on the top center of the forehead.
1,mario cart,most ly i want to say the price was good worth it and it is avery challenging good game the whole family loves it really you get to play differnt characters and race which is for my son so amazing he loves both plus loves mario he is a fanatic really and we all enojoy this game
0,Badly made piece of junk,The first time I tried to use this tool the spring came off and would not reattach. The screw holding the spring on was defective. What a dissappointment!!
1,Highly recommend,I bought this to match a seating group that I bought at target 3 years ago. It is a perfect match. My daughter and I put it together without any difficulty and it is quite sturdy. We are using it on our sunporch. It is quite tall and could be used outside for gatherings or by a pool for wet towels.
0,It Takes Two,"This book was a waste of money. Most of the material revealed in this book was obvious. In addition, this book focuses a lot on what men do inorder to decide whether or not a guy is into a particular women. But it takes two people to make a relationship of any kind work. I am not defending men and their ways. But ladies, if you don't do your part, no matter how much a guy is into you, he is not going to show it or waste his time. I have asked some of my male friends about stuff revealed in this book and they say that it is somewhat true. But they also say it depends on what the lady does that makes them act the way they act. I don't know what group of people were surveyed for this book, but some of the letters to Greg seemed stupid. Who would really write letter like those. As far a comedy, the book was not even really entertaining."
0,Laughing moles,I followed the directions - took all the hints and darn near watched the moles go around these things. Top that off with the fact that the instructions tell you to remove them if not eaten in a certain period of time - what a waste and what an idiot I am.
1,Good Product,"Reasonable price for hard to find battery type.Works good, charges properly, holds charge well."
1,Great insight.,"I bought this book to better understand some of the historical events that happened during the earlier years of our century. This book describes in great detail how our leaders of the time changed history for better or for worse. depends on your point of view. The author described in detail every leaders character, background and decision process during that time period. The author has a fluid style enabling the reader to follow her thoughts and perceptions, then tie them into the overall environment.I would recommend this book to all readers trying to understand our current status by looking back in a detailed past."
1,Not bad,I always liked this movie( Dr Butcher MD) for some strange reason. Its kind of a throwback sequel to Zombie 2 but different with the same lead actor. The Blu ray suprisingly doesnt look half bad compared to the dvd. A lot cleaner with better color.
0,"don't buy it, broke after 6 weeks, 2 months to repair.","Worked great while it worked, some really great features. But I have only had it about 6 weeks and stopped working gives error code U61 and shuts off. Just took it to a repair shop under warranty needs a new DVD assembly and the part is not avialable, has to be back ordered. Will take 2 mos to repair. Panasonic will not give me a new unit in exchange. Very disappointed in Panasonic, horrible customer service."
1,Fun and also vacuums,"Roomba is a cute little toy that also vacuums. You can send your hamster on a trip through the house, and everybody loves watching it. When I do the real vacuuming nobody watches me. My teenage son uses Roomba every day, and this is the first time that his room is actually clean.On the down-side, it is very noisy and takes a long time so its main useful use is when one is away. Also the room has to be prepared carefully before use so that Roomba won't get stuck or chokes on wires or little toys (such as Legos). I give it 5 stars for entertainment and 3 stars for vacuuming."
0,"Total Junk, Will Not Accept Returns, Gives Amazon a Bad Name","Please do not buy from this sell. The stuff they sell is absolute JUNK. The SIZING IS WAY OFF and they do not give refunds. And they will charge you $5.00 plus a 15% restocking fee because their sizing charts are a joke. Please Amazon, do not let shady businesses like this do business on your site. COSTUME CRAZE GIVES AMAZON A BAD NAME."
1,"High Energy, Attitude Filled, Amazing Jazz","Several years ago I was standing in a record store and found myself tapping my toes to this wonderful song that was playing over the speakers. It was followed by another amazing song, which was followed by two more amazing songs. It was the kind of music, that even though I had never heard it before, was immediately captivating. I went and asked the store what they were playing and it was this CD from the Cheathams. I bought the CD and I've loved it ever since. It is a very high energy Jazz. Jeannie has a beautiful voice with tremendous vocal expression which is perfect for the poignant lyrics that are often rather amusing and blunt (such as the final song that declares ""You need a doctor to take thw wrinkles out of your birthday suit."") The beat is very soulful and exciting to listen to.Enjoy!"
1,Her best book,"This is probably Cather's best book--and the easiest to read. It's not too long, moves pretty quickly, and doesn't bog down in any places. If you're new to this author, this book is the place to start."
0,Ooops..Ankit Fadia did it again!,"I am going to throw my two cents in! I agree with Ashely M (From Australia) that the initial three reviews are written by Ankit Fadia. They all have written only one review so far in Amazon.com and gave 5 stars.I have read Fadia's book before, and being an IT analyst, I can tell you that whatever he writes is crap and does not have any practical knowledge. It's very easy to write a book like that, because all you have to do is spend couple of months on Google, copy information from website, and paste it on your Word processor, edit it, and give it to publisher. However, the only hard work Fadia's does is choosing a good title for a book.This book is as bad as his earlier book. Don't buy and waste your $50 on this crap, instead donate it to Greenpeace or CRY.As said by one of the reviewers, I have to give one star as that is the least."
1,Beautiful ethnic mittens with a little history,"I was originally intrigued by the cover while looking for some ethnic mittens to knit. This book certainly delivers, having some wonderful examples of a variety of mittens with a plethora of color plate examples and ample-sized charts to follow. In addition, the book offers an interesting look into the four regions of Latvia and the variations found within those regions for mitten designs and colors. The patterns are easily followed as well as the techniques and meanings of each of the regional patterns. A must-have book for the knitter looking for a special project!"
0,Very poor prep book,"Just seems like any random math review, doesn't touch on what will be on the test, how it's formatted, and what we'll need to know and how to apply it on the test. Waste of money."
0,Poorly made - do not buy!,"I purchased this item for my 6-year-old grandson, who wants to be a policeman when he grows up. While the hard plastic items (baton, fake radio, flashlight and handgun) were about as you'd expect, the belt and handcuffs are definitely poor quality. Within an hour, the handcuffs were broken and the belt was falling apart. The holster and the loops for the light & baton were the first to fail. Then the belt itself began to unravel. I'd gladly pay more for a well-made product. I recommend against purchasing this item."
1,The Unknown Icon,"I saw Carole Pope and Rough Trade as a bar band in Toronto in the 1970s. One of the hallmarks of good music is that it keeps getting played. To this day, you can find The Doors on just about any jukebox on the planet. And 'High School Confidential', is, and always was, a little gem. Big-time film director Atom Egoyan used it in one of his movies not so long ago. It still gets radio airtime 25 years later. You can evaluate music on a technical scale - can they sing? Are the cord progession interesting? Can you dance to it? You can also evaluate it by it's impact - Did it touch people? Did it stay around? Did it create a style? Go buy this album. You'll love it on all counts."
1,"Read this book,your Bible and enjoy the adventure!","I have purchased many copies of this book (The Holy Spirit; The Key to Supernatural Living) and at the direction of the Holy Spirit given them to people that God has directed me to give. I use this book in my ministry. One night I received a call from a ministry worker to tell me that a family member wanted to take his life. I ask God what to do and I received instruction to read something from this book. I opened the book to page 146 and read ""A BALANCED LIFE"", we prayed together and God had me minister to the person, receiving the Holy Spirit. The person received the Holy Spirt with evidence of other tongues on the telephone! He lives today. God is so good! Thank You Jesus!!!"
1,"Moxy Lp, A tribute to there lead singer","This lp came out in original form back in 1984 about a year after Buzz Shearman, died in a motorcycle accident. Proceeds from the sale were to go to his son Jesse for his education. Its a well done Lp with some great tunes on it. I dont know all that much about this band, but had there Lp's when they first came out in the 70's. They can rock & roll for sure, they are from the Toronto Canada area."
1,love the mini helmet.,"Loved this little helment, fast delivery, an also was in great shape. Would purchase more for friends and family. Must have for eagle fans."
1,"Rich, shimmering textures","Rich, shimmering textures; innovative musicality; penetrating rhythms; evocative, stimulating imagery - all the features of the best of Tangerine Dream are present in this work. Among their best."
1,Works Good.,I use it for listening to podcasts so I can't compare it to a high quality audio MP3 but it sounds good right out of the blackberry (just as good as the tape adapter). The instructions say you need an attenuator if you want to plug it into the headphone jack however it sounds fine with a 3.5mm to RCA adapter (not included). Otherwise it includes all the wires you need to attach it to several different setups. This one does include an isolation transformer.
1,Simply some of the best singing I've ever heard,"""Somewhere over the Rainbow"" on this album is a wonderful jazz vehicle anyway, but Eva's version is SO GOOD, you will be blown away. I promise.Eva Cassidy was able to do jazz, contemporary pop and gospel with equal and outstanding talent. We heard her CD in a music store, stopped in our tracks and immediately bought every one of her CD albums we could find.A voice like Eva Cassidy's only comes along once a generation. (Think Mario Lanza, Karen Carpenter) And she is no longer with us, sadly. Her few CD's are real treasures."
1,It's Worth It!,My sister absolutely loved this mini cooler. It looks just like the picture and it came in a nice sized box. Truly worth it!
1,Massive Typos and Errors Don't Spoil a Good Yarn,"While this book must have been published without benefit of an editor or proofreader, and some of the author's prose is amateurish, it's a good story. I am about two-thirds of the way through the book as I write this, and would gladly recommend it, with a warning about the errors and typos. Apparently a few people in the film industry thought enough of it to schedule it for production as a motion picture for 2008, according to the Internet Movie Database. The story is based on real events, and a large flying boat did indeed make its escape as described. Of course, the Indiana Jones style characters and their adventures are the author's creation. I hope they do make the film. I think it could turn out to be a delight."
0,Horseshoes and Hand Grenades Leecraft CR-1 throat plate.,"Says it's for most Craftsman saws (nice way to tell the customer that it probably won't fit the one you own), but too long for the 22124 Cabinet saw. Cutting it down will cut into the set screw holes. It can be used for my saw but will take some careful cutting a tweaking to make it usable. For the price I could have bought a couple of cheaper inserts that I would have likely had to tweak as well but would have spent less money for the same amount of work. Sorry two stars is all I can give for the amount of frustration involved here."
0,Not reliable......bad product,"""Jumpstart"" is a pice of crap. It does not work even if it has a full charge. Wish I could send it back for a refund but I've waited to long."
0,Not in Love,"I decided to throw a little money at some headphones. I should have thrown more, I guess. The overall sound is OK, if I don't move at all, and if I can get them settled right. They're made of the kind of plastic that makes it sound like you have a couple of stryofoam cups over your ears. The headband was designed for something not human; it sits all wrong. The pad is comfy, though. The earholes are too small for my ears, and I'm no Prince Charles, either. Again, though, the pads are comfy. The replaceable wires seemed like a great idea at first, but the way they poke straight down out of the bottom of the cup, they rub my clothing and make a scraping noise in the aforementioned styrofoam cups. I think I bought Sennheiser because of some vague idea that Germans are good at this stuff, but I think I'll try some other nationality next time. Kinda disappointed for the money."
0,Worst Book I've ever read!,"It was sooo Long and boring, and for the first 10-20 pages you had not a clue what was happening."
0,Utter disaster,"Awful, unbelievably stupid, boring movie. The kind that makes you think about hitting the Stop button after 5 minutes, and end up doing it after 15... Don't be misled by those enthusiastic critics. This is definitely a complete and frustrating waste of money."
1,Can't Live Without It!,I needed a li'l sumthin' sumthin' to cover late night under eye circles...it's the best and the transluscent powder if FAB!
1,"Excellent, very well wrote.","Very good, I couldn't put the book down, at the end of the book it was strange because it didn't quite finish it off. I would of thought there would be more. I hope there is another about Deenie."
0,A nerve wrecker,"I do not recommend this book.The instructions are dificult to understand and follow,shows only diagrams not dollar bill photographs, the models are beautiful but make them is almost impossible and can make you feel sick.I waste my money and my time."
1,Great,I got this DVD wrapped and packaged great and it was in perfect condition but a slight hitch on the time frame due to the holidays.
1,"Agressive, Wild, Experimental & Honnest poetry","In this experimental album, Bélanger shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to ""feel"" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up."
0,Poorly Made,"I was very disappointed with the quality of these socket storage strips. The inserts didn't fit the socket recesses, and I had to squeeze each one with a pair of pliers to get them to enter the sockets. This was the case with both the 3/8"" and the 1/4"" sizes. Just another case of a trusted company settling for ""Chinese Junk"" to increase profit."
1,Fast Response,Product provides relief from shingles' persistent pain in shoulder. Not COMPLETE relief....but enough relief to make a big difference in my comfort and daily living. Amazon order arrived quickly and in good shape.
1,Close To You Review,"Close to You is a universally satisfying novel. It has a strong sense of mystery but also touches on comedy and romance. Eliza Blake is living a nearly utopian life until she decides to move out of the city. Not only is she stalked by a shady bartender, but trouble is sitrred up in the Key Newsroom by her co-workers. Attempting to keep herself and her daughter, Janie, safe, she is reunited with the past she tried to forget. I would strongly recommend this book to anyone who loves a good read."
1,A well rounded reinforcement of what you probably know...,"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and believe, at least for me, that it is truly the only networking book I'll ever need. The stories are relevant analogies which add to the author's message.With that said, most of what is covered are common sense ways of networking, which I found to be the underlying message of the book - ""treat others with dignity and respect, show genuine concern in them, their careers, and their families, and stay in touch."" Apply these simple concepts and you will have all the contacts you will ever need.There are some unique networking approaches Harvey shares with the reader. Those are worth the price of the book alone. I enjoyed this book and would recommend it to others based on my belief that it serves as reinforcement of what most of us really know."
1,Best book for new teachers,"After reading several other books similar to Ron Clark's no other book gave me the knowledge I needed to help me in the classroom. The author uses many personal situations to explain 55 things that help him in the classroom. Not only is this a MUST READ for teachers, but will help anyone in their daily lives. GREAT BOOK and fun to read!"
1,Lara: Book One of the World of Hetar,"I have been reading Bertrice Small books for a number of years. I have read all her books and I am faithfully waiting for her new book in the Friarsgate Series. Just finished reading Lara and I must say it is absolutely magical! I love this new spin on her writing Lara. It is a book filled with fantasy, love, magic and new worlds, nothing you can imagine. Only Bertrice Small creates these books that you simply can't put down. I can't wait to find out what Lara's destiny is. Looking forward to the next one. Way to go Bertrice !!!"
0,This release on Opera D'Oro has very distorted sound,"A marvelous performance in every way: great conducting by Clemens Krauss, and all the principle singers are excellent except for the somewhat matronly sounding Viorica Ursuleac-not an ideal characterization of Senta. Unfortunately the sound is very distorted just as the original Mercury LP's were distorted. Perhaps that was the master source for this issue? Anything above a soft piano dynamic sounds fuzzy/muddy as if the tape was overloaded by the microphone signal. From other reviews, it sounds as if the Preiser release sounds much better, but in the listening samples available I can still hear some distortion. It's a pity this great performance is not in clear, clean sound."
1,A Pleasant Surprise!,"Unlike the previous reviewer, I believe this is quite a good CD. There is one problem; you can't actually hear the orchestra on some of the tracks, which is a shame, because they make the songs pretty classy. I'm a diehard Chicago fan, and I've been upset with Cetera for seemingly distancing himself from his former bandmates. However, it's nice to hear him doing some old Chicago songs, mixed in with his solo stuff. Cetera's voice earns this CD a four-star rating from me. I've never heard him do much in the way of live stuff, and I'm impressed by his still-impressive singing voice; he manages to hit even the high stuff here. Now, if only he would get back with Chicago..."
0,u poor dopey clowns,"What a load of codswallop this all is.... The books bad enough, the reviews are even worse (most of them).... The church was ruined, thousands hurt, and nothing worthwhile achieved, and they have fourth rate nobodies bungling whatz left....Oh well, the falling away was prophesised, we'll see shortly who was right and who was wrong.... You might have to come up with some better material than this to justify your actions Mr Feazell....Cheerio... :o)"
0,Shoddy Tubes.,"I ordered two of these tubes to refit my road bike with. Prior to mounting onto the rim, I inflated both of them to 20 PSI. I instantaneously noticed three bulges on both tubes. Two were located next to the valve stem and one located about a quarter of a turn away from the valve stem. I installed the tubes anyway, inflated them to 60 PSI, and then put my road bike back onto the bike rack of my car. This bike rack keeps the bike off of the ground, ergo, no pressure on the tires. The next morning when I walked by my car I noticed that the rear tire of the bike was deflated. After removing the tire and tube, the tube had a 3 inch long tear right next to the valve stem where two of the bulges were located.I can only imagine how un-safe these tubes are in actual riding conditions considering the fact that they burst with no load on them and having never been ridden. I would certainly steer clear of these and choose another brand before trusting yourself on something such as these."
0,Shame on you LE Creuset,"I have this pan in the round version . It is the worst pan I have ever used . Having other Le Creuset pots and pans I thought it would perform like the others,NO WAY ! Everything sticks to it and it is next to impossible to get clean .I also have other cheap cast iron pots which I have use for years and they out perform this piece of junk by a long shot . I know how to season cast iron .Nothing can be done to this pan to make it work .Le Creuset should be ashamed of themselves for producing such an expensive piece of c@#p . Who are these people that claim it is easy to clean?"
1,Koss SB49 Headset,"Excellent product!! Great sound quality, and microphone performance is absolutely flawless. I use this headset for internet radio broadcasting, and mic performance is very critical."
1,Leaders are readers,"Whether you are a developing leader in the corporate world or just your daily life, this book is a valuable tool. I have read this book several times now and have gathered many valuable nuggets. I am particularly impressed by the basic truths and priniciples outlined in this book. Leadership, growth and health are not great secrets nor do they require extreme effort to attain. Paul leads his readers back to the basics that have stood the test of time. This book is one that I will re-read on a regular basis both to remind and inspire me to keep moving forward as a developing leader."
0,Don't buy anything from Dane-Elec,"I purchased one of these and it went bad about two months after it arrived. It claims to come with a 3-year warranty, but Dane-Elec doesn't respond to requests. E-mails to their tech support go unanswered. I've called their customer support, ended up in voicemail boxes, with no replies. So if you want to purchase a throwaway device, go for it, but I'd suggest picking a different manufacturer."
0,"Nice idea, poor execution","It is nice to see a product that has had a lot of thought put into its design and funtion. It is a shame to manufacture the product so poorly. First, the suction feature does not do anything. Second, this only worked twice. After I used it twice, the 'rechargeable' battery died and would not recharge. Its a shame that they went with such a cheap, crappy battery that it renders the product useless. The two times I did use this the results were great."
1,Good for the price,"This is my first digital picture frame, so I do not have anything to compare it against. I am generally very happy with this product - it is very easy to use, and I am happy with the resolution and the picture quality.The only downside to this frame is that the instruction manual is not helpful at all, and as one other reviewer noted, I had to learn how to do things by trial and error. I also do not like that when you make changes to the layout - rotating or deleting images, it is not ""saved"" to the memory card and so you need to make the changes each time.However, I like this product enough to buy more of these for the grandparents this next Christmas."
0,"Good brand, bad toaster","I just purchased this toaster. First time use, the center heating elements didn't work at all. Very dissatisfied with this toaster. I was excited to find this type of toaster but unfortunately, it FAILED! I was skeptical about the reviews at first, now I really should have thought twice before purchasing.I would NOT recommend this 4 slice Oster toaster to anyone. It's a waste of money and will be returned tomorrow!Now on the hunt for another! UGH!"
1,the great werewolf film of the year,"I think is the best film of werewolf films in lasts years good efects good sound,suspend at the last moment."
0,Bought 2. Same problem both times,"This is a nice mouse for a couple weeks, but like another posting I read, I had the same problem- it treats single clicks as double clicks. This can be a pain, as I've accidentally closed windows, and opened things I didn't intend to. I replaced my first one because I liked the mouse, and thought it was just an isolated case and that the one I'd replace would be different. But now my second one is doing the same thing!"
0,Oh. My. Goodness.,"I couldn't even get past 4 chapters of this book. It was absolutely disgusting what the people in that ""school"" did to those girls.It seemed like the ghostwriter had a (...) fantasy that he wanted to put on paper, so he did it to Teal, Phoebe and Robin.I'd skip this one if you liked the ghostwriter's other work."
1,Are you ready to change your life?,"I have read three books from this author. About a year ago, I came across with a book ""The Power of Your Subconscious Mind"". Everafter I have been interested in Joseph Murphy's books. Joseph Murphy explains you some of the most amazing laws of cosmic mind power that will help you on your path to success. He has written carefully 15 chapters on some of the most profound areas of the life.It has been my dream to move to the States, and become a police officer there. I believe that Joseph Murphy's books will help me to achieve my goals, and help others to help themselves.I promise that this book will reveal a whole ""new you"" to you. However, I gave it only 4 stars as something is missing from this book. It is simple, and a reader who is looking for very advanced hints won't find many of them. This book is a good and basic resource for creating success.. but I would still recommend you to read to read The Powermind System and Power Pause.I wish you the best success!"

0,A Tradgety and an insult to all those who fought in WWII,"Let me say, my grandfather fought in WWII, he voulenteered his life to save our freedom, he's still alive today and we both despise this game, you have the first level of Normandy, ok, probably the MOST famous battle (next to charge of stalingrad) in WWII, it's pathetic, you single handedly take over 2 mg42 nests. the game mentions about fighitng with fellow soldiers which you NEVER EVER EVER EVER do! this game is an outrage, pathetic AI, you single handedly take down a german submarine by yourself, infiltrate a nazi headquarters and somehow get promoted to sargent who really just gets [himself] thrown in 1/1000000 odd missions, just STAY AWAY, now if you were to ask me how is call of duty? then take every word i've said and do the opposite, buy COD. NOT MOH!"
0,A failure of a product,"It is scandalous that this proudct advertises it works with the Mac -- it's a handheld disaster. With 10.4.7, it will freeze your Mac and require rebooting. I seriously doubt they have spent any time trying to update the drivers for any changes to the operating system in years. Save your time and money, and pass on this."
1,greek music is the best!!,from such a beautiful beautiful culture!!! one of my favorite cultures in the world! this womans voice is very powerful and strong and gives me goosebumps!! great for chilling or driving or anything!! each song is totally different and it has a good variety of songs on this cd in particular
0,Disappointing,"I have read and enjoyed the previous books in this series, and this one is a big disappointment. Although Lupe remains an appealing character, the plotting is sloppy and there are too many unresolved questions."
1,Easy to use.,"My norton internet security suite is running out [expiring].I bought zone alarm 4 pro, which has a $10 rebate. The terms of the rebate truly sux because these pukes want your competitor's diskette or CD rom disc media.[Note: what if I roundfile ZA4 after a month or two. Now I can't update my norton or mcafee under the manufacturer's update program, becuase I no longer have a CD rom to make a photocopy of, as proof of purchase].Anyway, I have read lots of good reviews about pc-cillin and their high scores. So I downloaded their 30 day demo.I love it. It finds stuff my other programs don't/didn't.I'm ordering their full version today, as it has a $25 rebate on it [just an extra bonus]"
0,"NOT white block as described, or at least mine weren't","I ordered two lots of these for use in my classroom and I needed to be able to write on them with a Sharpie, but they arrived without the white block label, so they were useless to me. I paid for the privilege of returning them though the error was not mine, so it actually cost me money for no product."
0,cheap product,I did not expect much considering the stone. I did assume that the rest of the earings would be so poorly constructed. Buyer beware.
0,The True Story of PISS in Boots,"We decided to give this film a fair chance and watched all 80 minutes.We had thought this would a great educational film for children as we recognized famous pieces of western music such as, Beethoven's ""Fur Elise"", Mozart's ""Magic Flute"" and Verdi's ""Chorus of the Hebrew Slaves."" All of which were perverted by amateur remixing.The theme and moral of the film teaches children that bearing false witness will grant you women, fame, and fortune. Not to mention the awkward moment when Peter and the Princess are found in an empty bedroom in which they say ""Soooo, now what?"" There is also a question of what the film makers are implying by introducing a talking Jamaican monkey.If you look past the discontinuity of the plot, the poor voice overs, the animation, and the creeper chamberlain (weird pedophile pants!!!!), it was still an horrible film!!! Expel this from your TV like your body would expel urine."
0,Don't Bother,"This toy ripped along the seams after one use and lost air in one end BEFORE it was used at all. The size of it is nice, even for bigger kids, but if you are looking for a toy that will withstand even mild action for just one season, don't buy this one."
0,Not enough power to have fun,"My 4 year old son got this toy for Christmas last year and it has sat on the shelf for the majority of time since. Great idea but they need to do some major improvements on the fan power to push the butterflies up the tube. We found the only way it worked was if we had brand new batteries and then it would lose power within minutes. Not too impressed, save your money!"

1,What a cute book!,"I love animals and I've always wished that my dogs could talk. Amy is so lucky, I wish I had her luck!! Sometimes I wonder if talking dogs would talk often, but Sherlock didn't seem to speak non stop. I almost forgot he was a dog!!! I was mad when I read what Dr. Boden wanted to do to Sherlock, but in the end I was glad that Dr.Boden's boss decided that Sherlock was worth more to her. I'm very happy for Amy(I won't say what happens, so it won't ruin the story)!!!"
1,A musical biography with a captivating cast and score!,"As a person who is not a big fan of movie musicals, I was thoroughly impressed by the magnificent performance of Madonna playing the title role and singing the immortal hit ""Don't cry for me Argentina."" Jonathan Pryce and Antonio Banderas were also spectacular in their respective roles.Andrew Lloyd Weber's musical genius is captured in this touching and historic portrayal of the life of Argentine First Lady Eva Peron. A peasant girl who used her charms and elegance as an aspiring entertainer and rises to become the wife of Argentina's most powerful politician is sequentially presented with song and dance that only a masterful musical producer such as Weber could create.I highly recommend this movie to anyone interested in learning about the life of an important poltical figure of the twentieth century and being delightfully entertained at the same."
0,Fuzzy sound and WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER!!!!!!!,"Stay away from vonage! I have had it for several months, and have been trying to cancel it. I have been put on hold a MINUMUM of 45 minutes to and HOUR each time, and then transferred to someone ELSE who then does the bait and switch AGAIN. When you go to their web site, the only thing you can get is their custumer service number, which takes you RIGHT BACK to the same old nonsense. I need to cancel because of a military deployment, and all I'm getting is a run around...the same thing happened with AOL, but this is EVEN WORSE. There are tons of blogs out now about how VONAGE SUCKS...check them out. It's no wonder this company is tanking, their customer service is the absolute WORST!!!!!!!! I hope they read this.... they really need to change!!!"
0,Beware...this book is not so good,"I love books on artillery. I fully expected to get a book that had a history of U.S. artillery from--as the title says--The Spanish/American War to Present. What I got was an awful book with lousy production values that centered on a hodgepodge of photos about U.S. artilleryman UNIFORMS. Brother. The first couple of pages are color, and then the book descends into a morass of black-and-white photos. Now I know that a lot of (pre-color film) photos were created in B&W, but some are conversions from color to B&W...and very, very poorly done, at that. They're muddy; haven't been corrected at all, and the screening they did in production is abysmal. A real disappointment."
0,Book is a Bust!,"I really enjoyed ""Barefoot"" and ""Summer People"". This book, I did NOT like. The characters were uninteresting and annoying. The were characters that had nothing to do with the story, yet it dragged on and on (Lacey). The story drifted off too many times. There was no purpose. I had to struggle to finish this one."

0,not for small hands,"the armband for this nano sleeve didn't fit my hands - avg 108pound, 5'4 individual. Return involved a restocking fee. Not for all sized people."
0,Broken at the opening,These things are very shoddy. The hinge at the headphone is a weak plastic tube that apparently snapped during the packaging at Logitech.Others have complained that the earpiece was breakable. Ours was broken when the box was opened. This is planned obsolescense in action! In this case it failed before we got it. Don't buy these!
0,Worst Version EVER!,"This is the worst version I have ever tried to install. Many bugs, and nearly impossible to remove after installing. None of my registry cleaners could completely remove it! Constant problems with the apps crashing or not loading. I tried it on WIN95B, WIN98, ME, and W2K. I downloaded the 6.01 patch, but it also failed to install. Their WEB site is worthless for support, and it seems that everything you click on opens up some popup trying to sell you something else. 6.x seems to have some really neat features, however, I'd stick with 5.x until they get some of the bugs worked out."
1,"Proof that the USA is a ""Corporatocracy""","This book illustrates how the political donor class of America has steadily and systematically undermined the Democratic process of this country. I had always suspected that Congress had long since stopped representing its citizens in favor of money, but after reading this, I now know how it has happened right under our noses.The book itself is engrossing. I was so astounded by some of the claims here that I just had to verify them on the internet and other sources. Even more astounding was that most of the experts I consulted, not only knew about them already, but hadn't even blinked an eye about it.This is amazing work by Johnston. It should be read in every high school class room, along with the Great Gatsby and the other social classics."
0,Wonderful at first- then forget it,"Had this for 3 years. Worked wonderfully, and used it all the time. Then the hot water handle stuck open. As other reviewers said, it flaps and the flow is open until you turn off the water to the sink. After about 3 days, it suddenly seemed whole again, for all of 2 weeks. It cannot be repaired. The only fix is to spend another $200+ to get a replacement faucet. There are no repair parts available (the internal spring corrodes). Very poor design. Very poor customer service. Your faucet may be working now, but better start saving those quarters now for a new one in a couple of years."
1,hometown reading,"I am familiar with the area known as Cliffside; and in Ron Rash's book, I found it easy to relate to the instances and the people that are described. The stories are humorous, and the book is a good one to pick up after a long day at the mill."
0,bath faucet,"Buy Plumbing sent the wrong faucet for the second time. Apparently they cannot tell the letters DST from WF. I have now been without a faucet for over two weeks all thanks to Buy Plumbing. Never, ever buy from this company."
0,Failed again!,This is the second time I have bought this product. Works fine for two months and then kaput.Try another brand. I like the Panasonic even thought it has batteries. It does keep working unlike this item.
1,1512 is Great Tent,"I've owned this tent for 3yrs now. I purchased it for my friends and I to use when we go camping for the NASCAR race at Talladega. It's worked out great and held up very well. It has plenty of room. It sleeps 7 to 9 guys ranging from 6'5"" to 5'10"" on air mattresses or cots very easily. It's held up in some harsh conditions including heavy rain and 20+ mph winds. A couple of people can put it up in about 10 to 15 minutes."
0,ADJUSTABLE?!*?!*!,It IS sturdy. But it is majorly hard to adjust. I finally made it unadjustable by accident while trying to adjust it! There must be better.
0,Save your money!,"The authors of this book have confused being candid with being crass. This book is bursting with crackpot theories with my favorite being that lowering the pH of your body by drinking coffee causes you body to produce fat cells to protect your organs from the acid. What on Earth are they babbling about? Fat cells are created to store excess energy that you have consumed, it is your bodies storage system. Your organs do have fat surrounding them to cushion them, but this is on everybody and it isn't an acidic environment that is causing it.These nitwit women have taken small nuggets of science and twisted around so that it is complete nonsense. Throughout the book they cited their ""sources"". Almost all of them are goofy web sights without any credible scientific research backing it up.Save your money ladies. You all know the secret to weight loss already.....expend more energy than you take in."
0,Hobo's Handbook--Too Simplistic,"Looking through this ""cookbook"" I was amazed that it would be promoted by Men's Health Magazine. A majority of the ingredients for the recipes require processed and/or canned goods high in both fat and sodium.Anyone who is motivated enough to read a recipe and follow the instructions can do better than what is offered here. With the thick, kid-book like pages, the book seems geared more to a teen. The draw back, however, is that each recipe requires a trip to the store as the ingredients are not something typically stocked at home."
0,misinformation ruins even the best ideas,"I have no idea why this woman chooses to use Judaism as her first example if she isn't interested in what Judaism really has to say about food. There is a lot of wrong information in that section about the order, origins, and attitudes behind Jewish dietary law. She has tried to turn Kashrut into an ethical argument for vegetarianism which it is not. This is because all of her resources are books which focus on Jewish attitudes toward vegetarianism and not on traditions of Jewish eating. In a religion which has so many specifications for how to eat meat, which animals to eat, and the intricacies of ritual slaughter ... how can she say that kashrut and vegetarianism are even related? The few pieces of Jewish traditions in eating that she featured barely grazed the surface of the importance of food in Judaism. I don't know whether to trust anything she says about other religions when she has written so much wrong information about my own."
0,The Wrong Edition.,"I was looking forward to getting this book because I had seen it a while back but could never find it and when I finally received this, I was upset. I was sent the 50th anniversary edition of The Hobbit not what I ordered. as well as it was an old library book. the checkout card was still inside and had the library stamp on all sides of the books sides. Just know that the book in the image is not the book you'll receive. This was a very disappointing purchase."
1,5 Stars is Not Enough!,"This is my favorite book! When I finished it for the first time, I turned back to page one and read it cover to cover again....twice. 'Nuf said."
0,What's all the Hype about? This movie bites!,"I can't believe all the hype this movie has gotten. Aside from the fact that its is filmed inside of one room with different lighting, it fails to entertain. Perhaps its the one dimensional characters that we are supposed to mentally deconstruct. The acting was horrible. A fifth grade drama class could have done better."
1,Burger Press,"It's awesome. Makes it so easy to prepare hamburgers. I can pick the thickness (everyone is different. My grandson likes the ""skinny"" burgers, but I like the ""chunkier"" ones) AND have a perfect patty. It's fun to use as well."
0,Worst Cameron Ever,"I like the idea of Punk Bratz, but could you at least make them modern punk, and this is the uglies cameron ever made. don't buy it. its so ugly it looks like justin timberlake got messed up on the brain."
0,It could've been better,"Merlin could've been a better movie. I could point out all of its faults from beginning to end, but that would be wasting my time. There's enough here to add a commentary audio track on the subject alone. Unlike many bad fantasy films that are awful from the get go(DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS to name one), Merlin could've been one of the greatest fantasy films ever made. That's what really burns me up inside. The pieces to the puzzle were definitely there, but never quite fitted together. To make matters worse, Kathryn Bigelow(the talented director of POINT BREAK, and the horror classic NEAR DARK) was originally slated to direct Merlin. But negotiations fell through, and they had to settle for Steve Barron(who?!?!?). For NBC, the rest is ""kick yourselves in the head"" history. For viewers, another waste of time."
1,Wow... This is a powerful book,"I was blown away by this story and am still not sure what was real and what wasn't. Is Penrod a King of the Pygmies or is he insane? Is he in love with Daisy, or does she even exist? Is Pen's uncle a total drunken mad man or is he really a guy who's been overwhelmed with a gift and the death of his wife. This is truly a powerful book about illness, hope, and all of the stages in between. It's also shockingly funny. To say that Fuqua writes with power is to understate his achievement here."
1,A good collection,"I bought this album for my son-in-law, who is a big fan of surfer music and he loved it."
1,"A really amazing, compassionate, and courageous book","Everyone who suffers from depression, or knows someone who does, should read it for the important lessons it conveys. Kudos to Griffith and her son Will for being so willing to share their heartbreaking and ultimately uplifting story."
1,Really enjoyed,What memories these songs bring. The songs are like the actual but live. The voice quality was great and as I remembered as a kid. Well worth viewing.
1,Ehlers Danlos Syndrome,This is a very good book that gives information for finding all kinds of sources that have information about EDS. It is more of an information resource locator than a text book.
0,Tres blah...,"I loved ""Divine Secrets"" and ""Little Altars"" and now I think I will have to re-read them in order to erase the memory of Wells' latest book. As the other reviewers said, there was no substance or depth of character. There were glimmers of the charm found in the other two books, such as Baylor's story, but these were few and far between. The Christmas pageant at the end was excrutiatingly bad. I have to wonder if the author dashed this book off at the publisher's request."
1,Great Buy,I saw this item in stores but didn't like the price so I turned to Amazon. Not only did I find the item for less but in a different color that better suited my style. I like the bottle opener on the bottom of the shoe and the shoes are really comfortable. Free shipping was fast and an added bonus. Sizing runs true to actual shoe size and the price is way better than the retail stores in the mall. Overall the product is great and the expierence was good. I love these shoes!
0,DULL AT BEST,"Another chapter in the saga of Alvin Maker that seems to have no objective, form or substance. As I read this book I continually wondered when I would finally get to a part with some interest or relevance, I never found it. Follow Alvin as he whups up on the nasty white man and saves the blacks, injuns and French. Oh yeah, he starts to build his crystal city but not in any way you might have expected.Is it bad? No. What it is is boring. Too bad, I have been following this story from the very beginning and really enjoyed most of it. There must be some extremely virulent disease going through the fantasy/SF community that has wiped out the ability of many writers to actually finish stories. Hopefully they will come up with a cure soon.Unfortunately it will be too late for this one. It is DOA, terminally boring. I can't in all good conscience recommend this one, even to Mr. Cards most fevered fans. Hopefully he will put this puppy to sleep in his next volume."
0,Boring,The book(s) without questions was abviosly written by a person who thought the world would remain in the same day and age it was written in. I dont know what you think but I defiantly would not read this book again even if paid. The story's where boring and did not have a good body to them.~Stanly Welling
1,It really works!,"I bought this book partly for curiousity and partly to help me redecorate my house. Well, when I applied the principles in this book, not only did my house look great, but other aspects of my life improved as well (health, career, & relationships). Perhaps if your surroundings are in order, your life tends to fall into place. I found this book easy to read, but because different theories of feng shui were presented, it got a bit confusing. Eventually I figured how they're all tied together."

0,This is a terrible sexual instruction video,"If you are under 50 yrs. old this video is not for you! While expecting an instructional video to spice up our sex, we got a video that put both me and my fiance to sleep. We haven't even finished watching the video it was so boring! To much talk, not enough action."
0,Not a good help!,"This book is not very good mainly due to the fact that it doesn't explain what it needs to when it comes to a topic. The book does not go as indepth as it needs to go to get the complete concept across. Instead I would request the REA AP Chemistry beceause it allows you to practice with 5 Practice Tests, and then goes over every answer individually to explain what you did wrong. It is a much better study aid."
0,Not for me,"When I received this book, I was expecting simplicity. This book is difficult to follow. You must have a homeopathic medicine cabinet full of the items they ask for before you can come up with any remedy. The ingredients are very difficult to find.I got lost reading it. It was too confusing for me."
0,"Great idea, poor quality execution","The bottom part of this seat is not solid, or was not when I bought one a few years ago. They made it more cheaply by having hollow portions which can be seen when you lift it. The whole thing is made thin and cheap. If I'm buying a toilet seat, whatever the features, I want it solid and sturdy, not the quality you'd expect from a kids' sand toy set. I wasn't impressed with the cheesy potty training booklet that came with it, either."
1,ok..I finally found this version for a reasonable price,"I have been waiting patiently to see a rerelease of this excellent testiment of early Steppenwolf...LIVE in action...but I refuse to pay an assinine amount of cash for a cd. For all the insignificant garbage that sees its way into being released and rereleased....this is definitely one that DESERVES to be reissued.Ok....recent update....I found this version and didn't pay an unreasonable price for it..The sound quality is the same as the original vinyl LP.....minus any surface noise and pops.....If you have the availability of a good remastering software...I would strongly suggest using it on this one......You'll need to re-equalize and add some ""life"" into the mix....I haven't heard the new release they coupled with ""For Ladies Only""....but the price is low enough to take advantage of it."
0,Save Your Money!!! It Doesn't Work,"There are many things wrong with this product. As an A+ Certified tech, installation should be a piece of cake. Wrong. It has been a couple of days and no go. I will have to hook it up to one of only 2 USB ports on the motherboard to see if that would work but with a powered USB hub, it will not. But the big surprise is the (what I feel)lack of product support. You have a choice of 1. a forum 2. faq 3. email. The manual is all of 8 pages and it starts on Page 2. Better to use a PCI capture card and leave the USB headaches behind."
0,Out of sync,"I was watching this on KCET and had to find a place to comment. A few minutes after I started watching it I noticed parts were out of sync. Then I watched closer. Everything was out of sync! Clapton's playing a chord when you hear a ripping solo. That bad. Lips are moving, but no words begin to come out for a few more seconds. The music is awesome, but don't get this to watch Clapton rip it up. It just doesn't work.5 Stars for the music... Go and buy the CD instead."
1,Pure luxury for my swimmers' hair,"I have been buying Terax brand hair products since I discovered them in Italy many many years ago. I was reluctant to buy them recently because they were bought out by a US manufacturer, and I didn't think the quality would be the same. I was wrong. This shampoo does wonders for my dried-out, sunburned swimmers hair, and not many products can do that. I'm going to try some of my other Terax products from the new manufacturer as I need them."

1,Great Light Romance/Mystery with Western Theme,"Jean, a young girl of 15 is uprooted from her ranch home when her father is convicted of man-slaughter and sentenced to 8 years in prison. At age 18 she decides to earn enough money to repurchase their ranch and find the man she suspects of committing the crime. As with many of these old westerns, the romance is subtle and the mystery is not so much. It is a very enjoyable light read and I recommend it highly.This is a free Kindle edition"

1,How to make it look like true stainless steel......,"If you're looking for that brushed stainless look, then just spraying on the surface is not enough. coat the surface multiple times, then on the last coat, use a high quality wide faced brush with super fine bristles. Immediately after applying the paint, lightly go over the surface in a straight line with the brush. this will more or less guarantee as close to the real thing as possible."
1,Great Book,This book was full of good advice for many of life's common problems as given by a selection of great philosophers made easy to grasp by Alain. Some of it is funny. The book is easy ro read and can be read in less than a week. Some memorable advice presented is that pain in life is useful and should be use as a stimulus for accomplishments instead of being disregarded. Be ready for any disconfort since anything bad is possible. We should examine common held beliefs for their validity and not take something as true just because many people believe in it.
0,Damaged DVD,"The DVD came damaged. There was damage to the cover and the paper had several holes in the front. Furthermore, the product itself had damage. The DVD did not play properly - there were lines moving across the screen the entire time. I could not even watch the movie. I've never ordered a DVD online before this, and I am extremely discouraged from purchasing anything else with Amazon let alone another DVD. I am a frequent customer on this site and I normally speak volumes of your customer service and product quality, however this is seriously disappointing to me."
0,Please Hire A Better Editor Next Time,"As a big fan of the Canadian Power Trio, I tend to seek out anything ""Rush-Related"". Some good (Contents Under Pressure) and some bad (Mystic Rhythms).I did give this 1 star primarily because I enjoy reading other people's preceptions and interpretations of the complex themes presented by Alex, Neil and Geddy. Nothing earth-shattering here and some interpretations; ""2112"" appear to be way off compared to what Neil Peart acknowledged as his true inspiration.However, I hope the next time the authors embarks on such a subject, that they hire a better editor to proofread their product. The back spine acknowledges the three modern-day philosophers as Neil Peart, Geddy Lee and ""Alec"" Lifeson?!?! Pretty sad!"
1,Great work for 38 SPECIAL.-,"Great album for this Southern/Rock Band. All great songs but my favourites are the titletrack, ""The Love That I've Lost"" and ""Turn It On""."

0,Not enough new material here to warrant a book,"I am a great fan of Tom Tomorrow's and read the new weekly cartoons religiously. But much of the material here (I'd say about 70 percent) is simply reprinted from his previous compilations. Yes, there are some new pieces, and yes, there is a neat colour section in the middle, but when I shell out good money for a book I don't want to leaf through page after page after page of cartoons that I already have."
0,"Cheap material, doesn't fit very well","You get what you pay for, these were cheap sheets and they feel like it. They are also very skimpy with the amount of material. The bottom sheet barely fits the bed. The top sheet hardly has enough material to tuck into the bottom of the bed."
1,"I Like Chico, and I Like Gabor Even More!","I like Chico, and have listened to his recordings since the vinyl days. I enjoy guitarist Gabor Szabo even more, and here he is with Chico in a group at their best--good stuff!"
0,HORRIBLE!,"As far as I can tell, this nail file does a decent job of filing--but I cant be sure because it's torture to use it! It feels like scratching your nails down a chalk board -- literally. Every time I try to use it, I get that unbearable cringe in my bones that only nails-on-a-chalkboard (especially when it's YOUR nails) can bring about. But not only does it FEEL awful, it actually MAKES that dreadful, squeaking sound too. Save your money (and your sanity) and go buy a less nerve-grating product."
1,This definetely,"is a *GREAT* CD!!!Those who do not like Dixie Chicks would be in denial to say they suck.!They don't have to like them,but you just can't say they suck and truly mean it!!! Each song is wonderfully crafted.! The best tracks on the CD are ""I can love you better"", ""Wide Open Spaces"", and ""Let er Rip""(I totally *Love* that song.!)You may not agree,but those tracks are the most upbeat and I think Dixie Chicks do best with uptempo songs,but the ballads are NEVER bland they're allways sincere and wonderful.!If you don't have this CD go buy it because you will NOT regret it.!"
0,overpriced,"you can get this at most convinience stores for a lot less than 7 dollars. however, it won't be 9.5 ounces"
1,"Great toy for boys or girls (learning too, but don't tell them :)","We bought this last year for a 3 yr old boy. He plays with it EVERY day. Making special orders and pretending with mom, dad and his friends. His mom tells me they are using it to strengthen his math skills. I love it, learning while having fun :) I have seen the toy 'in action' and it's great!! I have on order more Melissa and Doug food items for this little guy for his bday and Christmas. The quality can't be beat in my opinion."
1,What to expect in LIFE EXPECTANCY...,"The first few pages of the book seem more like a fairy-tale than the usual suspense/horror of Koontz's novels. Nonetheless, if you continue to read past these pages, you'll find a book that caters to more emotional moments than previous novels. From that point on, I never thought about putting this book down again....a truly different, but inviting experience."
0,could have been better,"In reality my review reflects more on Helen Hunt's appearance than the movie itself. It is difficult to evaluate and appreciate the movie when you are bogged down by the appearance of one of the actors. Hunt has aged considerably and quickly and additionally looks oddly thin. I am all for an aging actress landing a role and doing so without Botox and other wonders of modern medicine, however, casting such an actress appropriately is essential to the flow of a film. In this movie, Hunt plays a 38 year old, while in reality she was 43, and looks beyond her 43 years. It is not a good casting decision. Unfortunately, Hunt directs and obviously made a poor decision here. Normally, I would hate to criticize appearances, but when casting someone to play a character a few years younger, the actress needs to convincingly convey a younger look. The opposite happened here, with a character that looks ten years older than she is portrayed."
1,---------->MASTERPIECE<---------,"Once in awhile, there is an album that just goes, like people say, totally under the radar.""No Reservations"" is a damn near PERFECT album, maybe with the exception of one song ""Big Wheels"" but maybe that's just me. From the start 'Railroad Man"" kicks it in gear, and you're like ""Hey, This is great stuff.'Then comes ""Indian World"" which you say to yourself ""Okay, this is personal.."" THEN you're literally BLOWN AWAY by 'STARS','NOT ANOTHER MAKER','BORN TO ROCK AND ROLL','TAKE A TRAIN' and 'I STAND ALONE'.I see people here selling this cd for a lot of money, and people. I gotta say this..It's WORTH IT'S WEIGHT IN GOLD.I have easily listened to this over a 1000 times in three months.An album like this you've wished Skynyrd would've made.It's that good.I believe that if more people would listen to this album, they probably would ask Rickey Medlocke to form BLACKFOOT again, and PLAY these songs-along with 'HIGHWAY SONG' from ""THE STRIKES"" album."
0,Not like they used to be,These are trash. Did not survive a run through the washer and dryer. Had to throw them away. Used the same ones years ago with my first child and they were great.
0,No track listing? No samples? I don't get it.,see above. I love kd. Why no info? I'm supposed to buy this blind?
1,An album only for true hip- hop fans who appreciate the art.,"Kool G. Rap & D.J Polo are one the most under rated rap acts. Road to the Riches is a well crafted CD that captures the essence of hip-hop, compliments of super-producer Marley Marl. This CD is jammed packed with raw beats and some of the most amazing lyrics ever to be placed on wax. Check out the singles ""Men at Work"" and ""Road to the Riches."""
0,Terrible audio.,The album I received sounds nothing at all like the sample. The music is so loud you can hardly hear John. It also sounds as though it was recorded in an echo chamber. The record label was Angel Records.
0,Where's Dave?,"I was really disappointed with this. This sounds nothing like Dave. I like their music because it sounds fresh and displays the great talent they possess. This has Dave on electric guitar and sounds way over produced. I hope the next one is back to normal and if not, well I'm still huge fan of the older stuff."
1,Creep is a classic horror movie,Creep is a classic scary horror movie about a monster living in the sewer and subway tunnels in London. Creep is the deformed son of a doctor. He kills his victims in many interesting ways but he is especially cruel to woman. He takes women to a creepy operating room and slices them open. Creep is ultimately a survial horror movie. Kate played by Franka Pontente falls asleep on a subway platform and has to survie a night with a monster trying to kill her. This movie held my attention through to the end. Creep is a must see for all horror fans.
1,Spira Men's Wavewalker Shoe,"My husband says these are the most comfortable shoes he's ever worn. He has terrible pain from a heel spur and no matter what he's tried in the past, whether it be an expensive sports shoe, orthodics or even shots of cortisone in his heel, nothing relieved the pain. He took a gamble and ordered the Spira Wavewalkers. He's so glad he did. His pain level went from a 10 to a 2. The shoes were worth every penny."
0,Does not work,"My phone would not reqognize that I had a memory card installed, so I purchased another one and it works fine. I would like to be able to return for refund or exchange."
1,Great Buy!,"Out of all of the Cirque du Soleil soundtracks, this one is one of the easiest to listen to without having to see the actual show before hand."
1,Another great funny should be Classic,"Like Shaun of the Dead, this movie is hilarious and fun and I loved it. These two guys are the present day Abbot and Costello duo, their humor and antics are superb and very entertaining. When you watch these guys you forget all your troubles for a little while, and isn't that what entertainment is all about?"
1,I'm glad I bought it.,I'm glad I came across this book and trusted the reviews I saw that was attached with this book. It's very different from a lot of other pregnancy books. It gives me more information on how I should care for my unborn child. It makes being a first time mummy feel more fulfilling and assured. Knowing what to do in order to give my baby the best in his/her future life. I really like to spread the word to the whole world of mummies that they should read this book. And thank you doc for writing this great book.
0,"How to squeeze 30 pages of plot, in the first 300 pages of a book.","I am a Steven King fan, but even by his standards, this book starts out real slow. I had a hard time not putting this book down until I got through the slow moving, and far too chatty first half of the book. The last half of of the book was better (although not great), but by the time I got to it, I was pretty much soured on the book as a whole. If I knew what I know now, I would have never bought the book in the first place."
0,Don't waste your time or money!,"This movie doesn't even deserve a *star*.Lousy movie.......instead of Lost Junction, it should be called LOST TIME!"
1,NIcholas Sparks.....Wonderful Writer!,"This book was in good shape and arrived in exact timing of what was told me. I set downwith this book and only put it down twice. It is a book that keeps you reading, it keeps youwondering what will happen. It is a #1 written book in my opinion."
1,Animal Meditation's,"I am a Shaman. I teach people how to interact with the various animals in/on our world. This book helps me by being able to teach a new student the subtleties of meditating with the intent of communicating with power/totem Animal's. The book gives basic instruction's that any beginner can follow. Beginner's usually need some sort of visual aid in order to enhance thier learning. This book supplies me with the visual aid that will help beginner's and will offer information that more advanced Spirit worker's could incorporate into their work. The link below will take you to the book ""Power Animals Meditation""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1879181711/ref=cm_cr_rev_prod_title"
0,This book is a HUGE waste!,"From the perspective of an Air Force brat/veteran/spouse, this book isn't even worth being toilet paper. Everything I've learned about being ""Married to the Military"" is by my own experiences and doing the ACTUAL RESEARCH required for the issues I had--anywhere from military pay to filing an IG complaint to Tricare.Mrs. Leyva wrote this book on the point of view from a Navy officer spouse, and the references to how to ""help your husband"" is a sure way to get him ridiculed!!!"
0,Very disappointing,"We bought this at Toys R Us. When we brought it home and found it didn't work at all, I decided to see what Amazon customers were saying about it. Had I checked here first (my daughter fell in love with it at the store) I would have known better than to waste our time on it. Ah well...Live and learn."
1,Another Wonderful Addition to A Funny Concept,"Another in the cumulative series that begins with ""If you Give a Mouse a Cookie."" The sound recording that comes with this one is particularly good, and although the novelty of the concept is beginning to wear off this is still a quite enjoyable book. Children from two to five love the humor of these books, and the silly fantasy can provoke some very funny play."
1,Perfect for overnight visits,"I bought this bed to use for my 3-year-old granddaughter who comes to visit often, as we do not have a regular bed for her. The slightly raised sides keep her snugly on the bed and she loves it. It is sturdy, easy to inflate and deflate and I foresee her being able to use it for a number of years to come."
0,It's OK....but,"The idea seems alright but the tool, especially a heavier tool like a drill, bounces in the bungee when you walk. The plastic belt clip also feels like it digs into your waist. The big lug hook is better because you don't have to search for the holder (especially while wearing a coat) like with this one although the hook is a pain sometimes because it tends to catch on things when it is empty. The big lug 2 obviously does not have this problem.All in all, it's ok but the bouncy tool thing is the worst part of it."
1,My favorite movie - ever!,"This is my ""go-to"" movie when there's nothing on television. I love all the character representations in this version. You won't be disappointed."
1,REALLY small... smaller than anticipated,"I actually purchased these for my boss because she had been looking and looking for some small funnels so she could use them to pour in a powder drink mixture into her water bottles. Well, I was ordering something as it is and so i decided to go ahead and purchase for her. Wow, these things are freakishly small. The only thing that could fit through the hole it comes with is liquid. And even then I would honestly be surprised anything would fit through that hole at all. However, nothing a good pair-o-scissors couldn't fix! I just chopped off the skinny part, pretty much right to the bottom of the ""V"" / cone shape and it worked like a charm. But just wanted to make sure people were aware of how tiny they were. Hard to know when purchasing online."
1,Best Book Ever,This book is amazing by far the best graphic novel ever made cant stop reading then see the movie!!!! Have fun
0,WORST DRUM THRONE EVER,"So i have been playing drums for about 10 years now and have used many different thrones. My last throne was a pretty standard Tama throne and every day I sit on this throne I miss my old Tama. This throne spins for height adjustment, which at first you think isn't that bad but after time goes on you realize that it is more of a pain then what it is worth. To get it to the right height you have to sit over it and spin it like a retard. You're better off just buying something else...THE WORST PART ABOUT THIS IS:I was playing my drums one day and I leaned over to pick something up and the mounts underneath the seat that is connected to the hardware snapped like a twig. This was way beyond repair. I am by no means a small guy (230 lbs) but my old Tama throne took a beating 10X worse then this seat and never even flinched. The motorcycle style doesn't do anything special either. Stick with the standard round seat."
1,excellant condition of dvd set!,The items I purchased were in excellant condition. Recommend buying from this seller in the future.
0,"Few hits, mostly misses with simple alt folk","1 1/2With the majority of songs being written in very simplistic 2 or 3 chord change settings, any artist needs to be on the side of subtlety, crafting movements out of minimalism..Deadboy and Elephantmen use this formula to partial success..The singer is obviously very talanted in his delivery and conviction, and the space used in between the sparse arrangements is usually worthy of the White stripes/Black Keys comparisons..But alas, the album cannot hold up, with material eventually giving in to it's overall laziness."
0,SELL OUT,"I think Ricky Martin tried to make a comeback in disguise as Rob Thomas... or Rob Thomas attempting to make a buck by sounding like a Justin Timberlake knockoff...Whatever...Matchbox 20 was original, they did their own stuff. This album sounds like every other over produced pop album that attempts to pass for music. Rob Thomas, who now looks like Elijah Wood and sounds like Justin Timberlake. maybe he should take a turn on Surreal Life with Flavor Flav and Jose Canseco. Talk about a mad season...he needs one! If you're looking for something that sounds exactly like everything else out there then this cd's for you, but if you're thinking this is more great Matchbox 20 type stuff then run away!"
0,Not 1 micron.,"The item says ""1 MICRON"" in huge yellow letters, under that a in blue smaller print ""2 LAYERS NOMINAL FILTRATION"", then in tiny light grey letters it says ""1st Layer 10 Micron Inner layer 5 Micron"".I am not too upset, they were only 10$."
1,Authentic Scale,"I am a collector at heart and this ""toy"" is certainly a great addition to that. This Harley-Davidson replica is catagorized as a toy, and it can be handled without fear of breaking because of its metal construction, but it looks so good setting on a shelf, you just want to gaze and dream of traveling cross-country on the greatest motorcycle ever made."
1,Save the children,"Something odd is happening to Anji, causing her to become telepathic, so the Doctor lands the TARDIS on the planet of Ceres Alpha to look for a cure. This planet is being settled by humans, but there have been some very odd children born...A rather dark book, with hints at the worst aspects of eugenics, it at the same time manages to be rather touching. The struggles of not only the TARDIS crew but also the parents of one of the mutant children against the planetary government focus in on the inhumanity of which humans are capable.Exactly how the situation arose is the central mystery to the book, and its slow unfolding is the central driving force of the novel's latter narrative.This is Steve Emmerson's second Doctor Who novel, and confirms that his first was not just a flash in the pan."
0,Lust is still a sin,"I agree with another reader who stated that the characters never really get to know each other or fall in love with who the other person really is because of the lust factor. The Bible states that lust is a sin. Even when you lust after your wife. You should LOVE your wife but not lust after her. Lust is a selfish motivation to fulfill your own desires.. is that how God loves the church? I don't think so. Sex inside of marriage sure, but it should never be just about getting what you want from the other person. In my opinion the story lacked romance because real romance is about love and not lust. Lust is very unromantic to me. It read like a trashy novel. Just my opinion."
1,The best there is!,"This is easy to clean, sanitary, and able to withstand 600 degrees. I use it for everything from moving the Thanksgiving turkey from the roasting pan to the carving board to carrying my Weber with hot coals without a problem. Some don't like the lack feel, but my wife with small hands has no problem using them. Personally I LIKE the lack of feel, the lack of feel of heat burning my hand is a good thing! Try it at a retail store to make sure it's okay for you."
1,Lots of helpful info and pictures,"Although ive been an oil painter for years, I've only recently started learning to sculpt with clay and make tiles. I came across this book in my public library and had to own it because of the enormous amount of information, the step by step instructions, and numerous pictures of finished projects and other works by artists it contains. The author is a very good teacher."
0,Music's too sluggish for Linda Perry's strong voice,"This album is a little too sluggish at times. While I like What's Up, the rest of the album struggles to find an identity. Too many of the songs sound like ripoffs of every alternative band that was hot in 1992. But the strong standout is Linda Perry's strong vocals. She sounds like she's not having it! Linda wins on the singing alone on every cut. But the music doesn't really match up. Perry right now is a very hot producer and songwriter for singers like Christina Aguilera, Pink, Gwen Stefani, Kelly Osbourne and countless others. Her Beautiful song for Christina even won a Grammy! She has really come a long way from this already forgotten band,and I'm sure some of the members are in other bands or quit music. Don't ask Linda to be on a One-Hit Wonders show (which VH-1 is so obsessed about these days) about this band--she's too busy making hits for the masses and I'd rather hear her do that now!"
0,Bland Bland Bland,"Cutesy bland country pop, sung with earnest conviction. Lovers of Garth Brooks and Faith Hill will doubtless approve."
1,Wonder woman with wonder,"One thing I definatly did not realize is the fact that despite the hype of all the other people clinging to the myth of the history of women of Thesymasera, I was a tad disappointed that they scraped over it and seemed to be simply the moments and path of Ares. He didn't create the island although he was the reason for thier protection. Hopefully in the future they will come back and show more of the role of Wonder woman in her continued gift to mankind not just this moment of revelation.Otherwise I thoroughly endorse this flick and loved the animation and creation process! Praise Gaia"
1,THIS MOVIE IS THE BEST EVER !!!!!!!!!!!!!,i dont know about any of you out there but i personaly think that the parent trap is a wonderful movie directed to all ages. lindsay lohen is a true insporation to my future acting career. i think anyone who hasn't had the privlage to watch this 5 star movie please do!

This has made a noticeable difference since day one. It has been well worth the money. HEPA filters are the real deal.I also have been looking for the filter and haven't been able to find one. I checked amazon to see what they were asking, and I'm flabbergasted at the high prices.Folks, go to the Holmes website. The filters are $13 there. I'm going to order 2 now."

It has been running 24/7 since then without any issues. I have also upgraded to ESXi 4.0 (vSphere) without any issues either.My 2nd TX4 card arrived today and I installed it without issue in my second ESXi vSphere whitebox.I've had no problems so far and the cards are not too expensive ...
0,Blurry Picture,"I bought this camera and was extremely disappointed because the picture was blurry and could no way be fixed. I think they have problems with the focal point setting on this camera. So I returned it.I exchanged it for the much more cheaper Logitech QuickCam Communicate STX. Once you check the advanced image enhancement settings for the C-STX to low light boost and color boost, the C-STX is one of the best cameras on the market. The Quickcam Fusion cam software did not have these options."
1,A broad spanning abridged collection of Yes's more popular songs,"First of all, this is a ""Greatest Hits"" cd, Not a ""Best of"" cd. I say this because their best work, namely the epics, are not on this. What you have here is a collection of their more popular songs from 1969-87. It's safe to say that most of these songs have gotten a considerable amount of airplay, and even a complete Yes virgin will recognize two or three of these songs.But, being a one disc album that covers almost 20 years of steady output from the band, it's bound to miss quite a bit. But you do get a sense of how the band evolved from it's late 60's British-prog roots to a more electronic pop band of the 80's.You do miss out on the more obscure recent output from 88-present, in which they return more or less to their prog roots, but bring their more electronic poppy sound to the music.But on the whole, this is a good cd for the casual Yes fan that only wants the hits."
0,"Terrible, Terrible Controller",Ok... this product works. It has that much doing for it... but it is wayyyy tooo small. I'm a reasonable short man with relatively small hands and this is just uncomfortable. Definitely get the Wavbirds
0,just an expensive toy,"The concept of digital binoculars is exciting. Unfortunately, the ones that have been produced so far are nothing more than expensive toys. You might as well tape together the cheapest binoculars and cheapest digital camera you can find. Most of the digital binoculars on the market are clearly toys, but this model has the appearance that it might be different. It's not. Look at the tiny lens in the center. Does it look like it would produce good photos of distant objects?"

1,This is an Excellent Book!,"I have found this book to be very helpful for any individual trying to have a better understanding of the principles applied in the process of marketing. This book, according to my understanding, has been designed to meet the needs of the average student searching for basic information as well as those individuals seeking deep comprehension of what marketing is all about. Through the use of a series of figures, pictures, real life experiences and applications, the authors make the book come alive and the concepts easy to grasp. I also consider it to be very important that this book covers, explains, and exemplifies five of the basic and fundamental elements in connecting successfully with customers (relationships, ethics, globalization, technology, and diversity). In conclusion I will qualify this book as an excellent tool to learn about marketing and all of the elements involved in this interesting subject."
0,"Awful, a joke. Someone should be fired at Infogames.","When you compare this with GT3, you're left wondering whether the publisher released it early just to ride the wave. I was one of the people dumb enough to buy it rather than rent it. My copy will be making its way to ebay shortly. If you like graphics that look like they lifted right out of a VIC-20, this is the game for you."
1,I was transported,"Rebecca should be proud of this long list of commentary on this book with an average of 4 stars. Based on their comments, the negative reviewers may want to ask themselves a few probing questions. I wonder how many of those who felt the characters were self-centered were volunteers, mothers, believers in a higher power etc. The characters in this book were real people with guess what flaws, among them, too much alcohol and nervous disorders. And guess what again, their faith and friendship continued to get them through life. (I loved the from the heart and soul prayers to the Holy Mother of God) Maybe a good lesson in here for all of us?"
1,"Brooding, moody, rich, challenging orchestration","Flugelhorn and trumpet virtuoso Tom Harrell, the composer and most important (but not the only important) soloist of this album manages to deliver interestingjazz orchestrations imbued with all sorts of Carribean and Latin instruments and orchestral principles...I believe this album to be equally appealing to hard-core jazz fans and to those in search of experiment, cross-overing or (postmodern?) mixing of genres.In addition to Tom, the soloists are Greg Tardy (cl, ts), Bryan Carrott (marimba), Romero Lubambo (g), Dewey Redman (ts), Danilo Perez (p), Mike Stern (g), David Sanchez (ss), David Finck (b), Duduka Da Fonseca (dm);non-soloing participants of these sessions include Regina Carter (vi), Ugonna Okegwo (b), Gary Smulyan (bs, b-cl), Leon Parker (dm, perc.)..."
0,Didn't last very long!,"I purchased this Sony-manufactured accessory for my PEG-TG50 Sony Clie, and I expected that it would last for as long as I owned the product. After all, it's just a carrying case, and it seemed relatively well made and stylish. However, the internal plastic lock/release mechanism that holds the Clie in place is broken after only two months of use. Not particularly durable! I'm exploring my warranty options even as I write this, but I'm not hopeful."
0,a turd by any other name...,"Avoid this dud and do yourself a serious favor. For the life of me I can't imagine how someone could find something profound in this misguided faux teen-angst vision of non-reality, unless this is the first book they've ever read and they think child rape and sexual abuse is profound. I will say, however, that it is profoundly derivative in a major way: oh, look, the author just read Flanner O'Connor...oh, and that's Dennis Cooper there...oh, there's a tad of Mary Gaitskill. The only problem is that it lacks the real talent and genuine vision of those writers. In other words, it's more like The Monkees than The Beatles, just not as good as The Monkees. So avoid this worm on the hook, really. You can thank me later."
0,Soft = Loud,What is up with this new Soft = Loud thing?Kind of dull...It's like Lillith Faire for men. ?I guess...They look mad cool though. All brown and like Greg Allman circa '72.

0,TRUE TO THE GAME/TERRI WOODS,"THIS BOOK WAS FOR A YOUNG ADULT OF MAYBE 18YRS OR 19YRS OLD!! ONE WHO FOR SURE DOES KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE UPS AND DOWNS OF STREET LIFE IN THE GHETTO. ANYONE WHO DOES NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT THE GHETTO MIGHT THINK THIS IS WHAT THE GHETTO IS ALL ABOUT. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD BOOK TO LAY BACK, RELAX, AND READ. THE BOOK WAS AS TERRIBLE AS THEY GET. I AM NOT FROM THE GHETTO, BUT I HAVE FRIENDS WHO ARE, AND BELIEVE ME I THINK THEIR STORIES WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER NOVEL. I SUGGEST TERI WOODS TRY AGAIN AND NEXT TIME LEAVE GHETTO LIFE ALONE!"

1,A MUST BUY!,"Everclear decides to go with a lighter feeling in their third CD, Songs From An American Move, Vol.1, Learning How to Smile. It is reminisent of 'the good old days', and has been spinning in my CD player nonstop for weeks. You will not be sorry if you buy this excellent CD, so go ahead! In my opinion, the best tracks are AM Radio, Learning How to Smile, Wonderful, Annabella's song, and Otis Redding."
1,It's great to get to know the genius behind the music!,"I just bought this book the day before yesterday, and am only on page 42, but it's wonderful...this book makes you want to keep reading and reading-it sucks you in! I was amazed at all the famous names mentioned and how Mr. Zimmerman (I love calling him that...) writes about how he felt about these people and their effect on him. I was also captivated by him talking on and on about different books he had read. They were either written by or about some of the greatest people in history! I dunno...I just think it's awesome to be able to see who and what Bob Dylan, an American icon himself, is and was inspired by. I guess that's my main point...get this book! You won't be able to put it down!"
1,Spy Thriller,"This provides a detailed,fantastic portrayal of intelligence operations conducted by the British Army in Northern Ireland .It shows the brilliance of British Intelligence in recruiting and preserving a mole at the highest ranking level within the IRA.It details the skill and the disturbing moral questions in doing so.It also describes the skill and ruthlessness of the IRA.The one problem with this book ,is that it does not list any evidence to back up its main theme and various allegations,we can only infer that it is credible,so becuase of the way that Scappaticci was exposed oto the British media"

0,Too big!!,I like big watches and I am a big guy but this watch is huge. If you want a watch that with cover your entire wrist this is it. Did not own it long enough to comment about the function.

0,So much was left out...,"I am amazed by the five star rating for this book as the author left out so many terms that a true beginner would want and need to know.

0,Extremely disappointing,"The plot is marginal, the characters hardly developed. As a reader, you don't care what happens to the hero or the heroine. It's even hard to believe they fell in love, given the scant number of scenes where they actually talk to each other.Aside from all that, although the book was 300 pages (of very large print and 3 page chapter breaks), it felt a whole lot longer. This was one romance I could put down, again and again."
1,This stuff is great!,My boat is about 10 years old and has some oxidation on the front of the boat. This product worked great... I am very happy with this purchase and will continue to recommend this product to other boating friends of mine with the same problem.
0,Don't buy this!,"Before doing this stupid act, please look for real information on Jane Fonda. Her book ""My Life So Far"" is a great start if you are interested in understanding what is going on."
0,Not A Smoker,"I read all of the great reviews and looked forward to receiving the ""smoker"". But it was quite a let down. Nothing but a way to bake food and hope it picks up a little of the smoke taste put off by the sawdust they call wood. I sent in back and would not recommend at all."
0,Good but gritty,"I bought two flavors of Gloria Jeans k-cups. I loved the price. The coffee is wonderful(!), but I hate getting grounds in my coffee! I've had about 1 in 5 cups that have coffee grounds *under* the filter, so when the coffee brews they end up in my cup--about a 1/2 teaspoon per cup. Lower price = poorer manufacturing standards."
0,Terrible,"This is one of the worst Civil War videos I have ever seen. I knew something was wrong when the opening scene was a distant Lincoln impersonator who lips were out of sync with the voice track. I couldn't watch this stinker which was nothing more than a long slide show of generic images with a narrator reading a voice track. It reminded me of a BAD history class when a teacher talked through a Powerpoint presentation. I don't know who gave this a good review, it must have been people who have a financial investment in the DVD. Please save your money."
0,If you like overheated prose . . .,"you will like this book. Lynch's ""poetic"" prose is purple. If you like Sherwin Nuland or David Berlinski, you will like this book. If you prefer crisp writing, you will not. I couldn't bear to read more than a few pages."
0,Runs through batteries like water,"I have thought several times that this product stopped working because I couldn't fathom how it could go through a nine volt battery in just a few weeks. When I tried (just in case) a new nine volt, I found, each time, it still worked. It simply runs through batteries like water. 9v batteries are so expensive! In the course of a year, I have spent the equivalent of the scale's cost several times over. I would not reccommend this product to anyone, and I surely would never buy a Salter product ever again."
0,Is Jar Jar running Lucas Film now?,"I'm tired of the constant changes that 9/10 times don't improve the film. Great, digitally enhance it, THX...w/e, but stop changing everything. I have been a die hard fan for years and years and I will not be lining this mad mans pockets for destroying something that was amazing.Someone put him in the Sarlacc pit already."
0,total 3d landscape delux 3.0,"Unless you want to be completely frustrated, I would not recommend this program. The 'handles' used to shape terrain, ponds, etc. often do not work and you can not work within a grid when laying out the terrain so you have no idea where the hills are in relation to the house. Building the house is very confusing because of the way the program has set up 'levels' for the house. Sometimes you see the house, sometimes you only see the fence, sometimes you can modify existing structures, other times you can not. Definitely not a user friendly system. Also, the plants are mislabeled: an iris is labeled as a clematis, a verbena is labeled as a stokesia, the same photo is used to portray two aster varieties, etc. As far as I know, you can not make a plant cascade over a wall. I could go on....The technical support people do not answer emails and the help phone number is computerized; I waited for 15 minutes and then hung up."
0,just adding another bad review to the pile,The only time this thing ever bucked was when my kid forced it too. No matter what the level setting 1-3 (3 being the hardest) it was beaten EVERY TIME.Also there were times when it was very difficult to get the saddle to stay on. Save your money and avoid. I am not sure how Hasbro can sell such a piece of junk.
1,Back to the Future Part II review,Watch this awesome sequal andP.S. Iam still waiting for (spoiler alert) my hovering skateboar and my flying car.I LOVE IT!!!
1,Great movie!,"Must see- very meaningful and well done! Great representation of the time period, meaningful storyline, witty script, and great acting."
1,Australia,My daughter has viewed this film and said it was very good. I will watch it over Christmas school break.
1,A man of many talents... Sean Connery can also sing!!,"This is great if you have any interest in Irish folklore, Disney movies, ghost stories and of course ...Sean Connery. This is one of Connery's earliest roles and highlights him as a field laborer in a small Irish Village. AND HE SINGS!!My parents and I used to watch this movie all the time ... it is a family movie. Wonderful acting and special effects as only Disney can offer them.I can't wait until my copy arrives!"
0,Disappointed,We registered for most of the malawi theme. However unfortunatly when the pictures arrived there was shipping damage. The quality of the wood frame is very poor. The pieces are glued together instead of an actual frame. Please be aware if you are to have these items shipped. You are better off going to the store to purchase.
0,not the music of the movie,hi i saw the movie this is not the music from the movie. i would like to buy it but this isn`t it.
0,Do not attempt to purchase this refurbished.,"This camera is a worthless p.o.s. if purchased refurbished. I cannot vouch for a new one, however.."
1,Fabulous Vera,"If you like British mystery series, you might find this one of interest. It's not the charming drawing room type, with tea and butlers and crumpets and vicars. More gritty, windswept, somber scenery. Vera is a shrewd, sometimes impatient, sometimes motherly detective who gets results. The fun part is she hypothesizes out loud with her team as to who is the villain and why--the crimes are complex. I couldn't guess who the perpetrators were as there are enough plausible plot lines, motives and villains. These stories seem very realistic, not cozy, but not overly-gruesome either. Love to get on the treadmill and exercise to these. The suspense keeps you interested."
0,Did not like this,The characters were not likable. Too much holding on to the past making the characters shallow and insecure. Just not a good read.
0,Sent me to the crapper,"Even by Troma standards, this is pretty low. Not because of the filth, sex, perversion and general goofiness--I like that stuff. But the execution here is rather slipshod. Really seems like stuff that they would otherwise have thrown out, put on display to make money. At least the title is accurate. But there's too much Lloyd Kaufmann. He has a few good lines, but he's not as funny as he thinks he is. Debbie Rochon is wasted in a small but potentially funny (and completely clothed role). Julie Strain is best in pieces where she is overbearing, which is most of the time. But when she's not on screen, the movie slows to a crawl. For me, there was just too much tedium and not enough laughs."
1,Perfect bag for daily use.,"I carry this everywhere I go. It is the perfect item for my grad student on the go lifestyle. I only wish it were sliiiightly bigger. It fits my 13' Macbook Pro so snug that I cant fit anything else in the bag. Ultimately, I love it. I just wish it were 15"" instead of 13 even on days when I'm not carrying my laptop. 4 stars for being such a great and usable tote."
0,Not Pleased,Heart Rate feature only worked occasionaly. May have just been battery but they shouldn't send them out with old battery. Watch band looked very cheap. The plastic band will not last long.
1,"Excellent, compact","This is an outstanding, compact book on Java 2 certification. The author covers the main point very well and the sample questions are excellent. It is good companion book if you are new to Java. I used it to for review and pass the exam easily. Comparing size and the quality of the content, this is a better book than the large books, full of errors on the market at this time."
1,One of the best of its kind,"This is one of my favorite CD's. The music is fairly well described in the other reviews, so I won't add to that, but I'm surprised that 2 of the 3 previous reviews pan it. Usually even mediocre albums get nothing but rave reviews, and if there is even a little criticism it's usually s bad sign, but I have over 20 CD's of this style and to my taste only the benchmark ""K & D Sessions"" and Nightmare on Wax's ""Carboot Soul"" can compete. It's cool, relaxing, sexy music. I most frequently listen to it while stuck in rush hour traffic to keep from pulling my hair out and almost regret pulling into the driveway. I've played the CD for multiple friends and they all like it. Those who are into the style agree that it is one of the best of the genre."
1,Still Their Best Album,"This rock album is absolutely wonderful. You won't need the skip-track button because every song is great!Overall it's a dark album. 'Dark' meaning the songs are, well, not happy. The first song (and my personal favorite) ""Torn"" starts off with a beautiful, lonely sounding clean guitar riff before moving on to hard and angry electric guitar riffs. This song really sets the tone for how much of the album sounds. At times you're hearing nice acoustic riffs like the beginning of ""Pity For a Dime"" (song #4). Other times you're exposed to harder electric guitar riffs like ""Ode"" (#2). And Scott Stapp's vocals go along nicely with the music.The end result is a very enjoyable listening experience that should keep you entertained throughout the entire 49min+ CD.I highly recommend checking this one out."
0,I do not like Finnegans Wake,"I think it's rather dumb to write a book for the purpose of making it difficult to read. If you want to be allusive, that's fine, but express yourself coherantly and in an unambiguous fashion. Ulysses and A Portrait managed to be both timelessly powerful and legible; it's a pity Joyce didn't make better use of his seventeen years."
0,Confusing; Chaotic,"I think it would have helped me if I had had a strong interest in the period of time the story took place (Middle Ages?). It was a physically unattractive movie, and the plot seemed chaotic. Also, I had bought the movie because of my interest in the young actress, Natalie Morse, but she spent most of the movie in an underground cave. I don't recommend this film."
1,Glass: An Artist's Medium,I liked this book very much. It was very informative. I'm glad I purchased it.
0,"Fantastic music, but disc won't work in many players","Yann Tiersen produces some truely amazing music. Get Good Bye Lenin, and also check out Amelie and Rue De Cascades.But, as stated by another reviewer, be aware that this disc will not work in many CD players, and especially computer CD rom drives.Apparently this is because the 'copy protection' on the disc breaks the CD standard.I would suggest buying the music on-line."
0,TOO SLOW,I purchased this typewriter a few years ago and I really dislike it. I am a fast typer and the striker doesn't keep up with the speed at which I'm typing and it gets confusing to hear it strike after I've hit the keys. I feel as though I'm always waiting for the typewriter to catch up to me. The clear plastic paper holder doesn't do a good job of holding the page close enough to the carriage. There is no line guide so that whenever I want to type on a certain line on a page I'm either above the line or below it. And because I lost my owner's manual it took me some time to figure out how to get it out of the CAPS Lock mode. Other features as well are just too confusing for me. I'm looking for an IBM.
0,Needs improvements,"Bluetooth is cool, but this phone freezes up, randomly shuts down, and the camera sucks. Too bad because the display is really terrific."
0,Makes an awesome gift for someone u hate,"I heard of these guys through their stopnapster.com site and I wanted to hear what they were like. All I have to say is that they are the most bloody awful band I have ever heard...this album is just plain terrible. This has nothing to do with the napster controversy, any sane person would agree with me that this is one horrid recording. There is one good thing about it though, it would make an awesome gift for someone u hate."
0,Crummy,"As another reviewer commented, hinges broke immediately upon removing fan from the box (whole thing is held together by 2 dime-sized pices of paper-thin plastic). Fan is useless without them. Additionally, fan is advertised as battery or AC operated, however an AC adapter power cord is not included. Whole thing is typical of the quality I should have expected from a cheap plastic chinese-made item, I suppose."
1,Great knee wrap!,I recently increased my running significantly and experienced left knee pain. I bought this with the intent of wearing it at work and still being mobile. I can't seem to get it to stay up when walking but I haven't tried very hard either. It works great sitting and laying down though and I love how it encompasses my entire knee. It stays cold for over a hour too. I haven't tried the heat yet so can't comment on that. Definitely recommend if you don't plan on walking with it.
1,It's back to Vegas!,"Ocean's Thirteen takes place after Ocean's Twelve returned from their European heist.This time the target is Las Vegas' finest: Willy Bank. Up against such overwhelming odds Ocean has to ally with someone he never thought possible...George Clooney, Brad Pitt, Matt Damon, Andy Garcia, Al Pacino, Elliott Gould, and the rest of this AMAZING cast, have outdone themselves with their performances, which are exceptional to say the least. Very well written and very well presented, the movie is without a doubt guaranteed to provide more than just a few thrills, not to mention a few laughs.The setting, the plot, the dialogues, the humor, and the music are all wonderful!In short, Ocean's Thirteen is a movie definitely worth watching and one to seriously consider adding to your movie collection along with the other two in the trilogy!"
1,A swingin' holiday suprise-Christmas with BBVD!,"A rare find, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy's 1996 release Whatchu' Want for Christmas gives the listener a peek back @ one of todays original, 'classically fresh' and unique swing bands. This album is a mix of early recordings of their current hits, You and Me and the Bottle Makes Three Tonight (baby), Go Daddy-O, The Jungle Book favorite, I Wanna be Just Like You and, three Christmas tunes that promise to get you in a swingin' holiday mood. If there is one thing this album lacks it is the presence and ""finishing touch"" Josh Levy (piano, vocals) and Karl Hunter (alto, tenor & baritone saxophones, clarinet) provide in the band's current self titled release. Amidst all of the '90's swing' being thrown our way, Big Bad Voodoo Daddy offers an original yet classic swing sound that will leave you Jumpin' Jack... Go-Daddy-O!!"
0,repeat information,"The dvd is mostly repeat information from the great book by Debbie Ford ""The dark side of the light chasers"".I found the dvd very monotonous and boring. Stick to the book."
0,Uncomfortable fit,"Underwear is a pain to buy. Surprisingly expensive and you can't really try it on at the store before buying. I've been a fan of Undergear's brand underwear, but it is pricey. I was trying to find a suitable, less expensive alternative. I gave the hanes a try. Fabric was thinner, elastic sharp and the overall fit was just odd. I think I'll stick with undergear product."
0,"BRITISH Southern, not USA's Southern; Ships, not Trains!","Careful! A train enthusiast (like me!) might read the title and subtitle of this book and think: ""A review of (US) Southern Railway's [locomotive] fleet in 1946"" Ah-ha! An undiscovered treasure from SR's steam-to-diesel locomotive conversion period, for the year following the end of WWII, when the [locomotive] fleet was exhausted from all the extra wartime service. Sorry, but no . . .! In this case, ""Fleet"" really does mean ships, and this is the ""Southern Railway"" located in Britain, not the Southeastern U.S. . . .!Not a bad little book, really, for its topic. Full of B&W; ""large-postcard"" size photos of a bunch of British ships; from 1946. The book is in a ""large-postcard"" format, softcover binding, a bit of blue and red for the cover.Remember, to paraphrase the old saying, the British and Americans are two people divided by a common language . . .!"
0,Not as good as it should be...,"I am a big fan of biographies, and read them a lot, especially of historical figures. but I was disappointed with this book. It had very little information on the young Rommel -- what he thought and why -- or the motivations of the older Rommel. Most of the book is more of a narrative history of WWII in Africa and Europe, and not a very good one at that. It has very poor (and very few) maps to follow the action, and, to me, some mind-numbing narrative of hard-to-follow battles. In my opinion, the best biographies are the ones that really give you insight into the thought processes of the subject (e.g., the David Cullough ""Truman"" or the Stephen Ambrose ""Eisenhower""). This book did not do that -- I feel that I don't really have much more of an understanding of Rommel now than before I read it. I guess I'll have to continue my search for the definitive Rommel biography."
0,Intermittent CD Player,"I have returned this unit twice to no avail. It has an irritating flaw of not recognizing/not loading a CD and skipping its place in the tray. Sometimes it plays all five CDs, sometimes only one. Not what I expected from Sony."
1,Awsome and worth the $$,"Ok this is not a cheap shirt and yes I know that. I got my first one on clearance online for about 15 bucks and fell in love. So now I have three and am getting a forth.Greatest undershirt/thermal shirt EVER. It always keeps me warm (and I am a FL person) and the best thing is when I am nice and snug in this shirt I never feel like I am sweating or overheating. It does an excellent job of keeping you dry, warm, and comfortable. Also the craftsmanship/stitching is top notch so no worries there and it really is tailored to a womans body very well. I would really recommend this - overlook the price and try it and you will not want to take it off."
0,Two narrow to be considered Dentaltape,"This possibly could be considered an extra-wide dental floss but scarcely a tape, even for dental use. I find many uses for dental tape outside the oral cavity and am looking for the type of dental tape that used to be available. This is not it. This serves my purpose only after doubling and redoubling it, then twisting it so it can be easily handled--a lengthy and awkward process."
1,Nice and affordable bible,"Well crafted bible, nice job on the leather bound cover. Good sized font with the words of christ in red. Well worth the money!"
0,Least Favorite Baby Einstein Video,"I have had excellent experiences with Baby Einstein DVDs but this one is disappointing. I usually cannot pull my daughter away from them however she refuses to watch this one. I don't know if it is just because it is so slow or because of the various languages, but I don't recommend this one at all. Try other Baby Einstein videos because they are usually excellent."
1,"""A comedy that cuts deep- hilarious and horrifying.""","""Critically acclaimed at Cannes yet threatened with censorship abroad, 'happiness' deserves to do for Todd Solondz what 'Pulp Fiction' and 'Boogie Nights' did for Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson. Although it lacks some of the punch the stellar ensemble provided for the film, Faber and Faber' s screenplay allows you to focus on Solondz's prodigious talent as a screenwriter. Painstakingly funny yet deeply disturbing, alternative cinema at it's finest."
1,awesomest maximus,Awesome funny movie...I enjoyed this show with a bunch of friends.it's funny you won't stop laughing from begining to end.I will see it again....get ready for great laughs!!!!
0,I expected better,"After the cd release date was pushed back several times, I thought it was because Ruben was working really hard on making it the best he could. Soulful?, sorry its more like SLOWful."

1,Using as a Bass Guitar Amp Speaker,I disconnected the crossover and am using the speaker with my 400 watt rms bass guitar amp head. Works great
1,Great game,I bought this game for my then 10yrs old that was back at christmas 2006. The hand held has held up great to this day. yes there are updates but that has been few and far between. It helps if you have a very fast connection so that when the hand held syncs with the online world it wont take long. The virtual world is the best part of the hand held. my son plays for hours on end and always wants to go back for more. there have been a few times when the site was done but that to has been few and far between. I gave this a 5 star for a great virtual world to play in and the hand held being a great device. The key to the success of this hand held is a very fast connection to the internet.
1,I remember this,"I, also, saw this film on cable in the early '80's. I thought it was a very good movie. Creepy, and you actually cheer for the possessed main character. His tormentors get what they deserve!"
0,Great toy - SHORT BATTERY LIFE,I bought one of each of these microids for my 3 boys. They love them and played with them a lot. The battery life is only 40 MINUTES. They take 4 LR44 hearing aid batteries which cost $2.99 each. (...) to replace the batteries it cost me $12! and the kids could only play for about an hour!
1,The Tender Bar,A comimg of age story from the point of view of a young man with an absentee father. Great little book with vivid character descriptions. Just enough twists and turns to hold my interest through to the end.
1,"great book, worked with my 3 kids, one with autism.All were 2yr!","This is an outstanding book. My mother used it with me & my sister in the 70's! She gave it to me with the doll for my sons 2nd birthday. I read it & did it a couple of days later. He had severe autism & still did it by 4pm that day. I potty trained my next child & she was 22months. Just recently I potty trained my 3rd child, 20months old & she did it without a hitch. Nothing cuter than seeing a baby running for the potty, pulling down her pants, going, emptying it herself & flushing. My only obligation after the first day of potty bootcamp is to jump up & down & give her a treat for her hard work.The first day is hard work, but well worth it & no negative standing around or shame involved."
1,"Excellent, just like the movie","Not much can be said that hasn't already been said in the other 500+ reviews. This book is great, albeit violent. It seems to be the ""simplest"" of McCarthy's books I have read so far."
1,this album is the bomb,This album is truly the bomb i got it (twice) and i listen to it every day. i love this group because they have their own style and they are very creative. They take every day situations and sing about them from going through hard times to staying commited to the person that they're with if you don't have the album get it and listen they will have you hooked.These four young men are truly magical and they had me under they're spell since 96'! THEY ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THEY'RE SECOND ALBUM IT'S GONNA BE HOTT!
1,Toasty Warm Feet!,"Great product, but size is hard to figure out! I normally wear size 10, size 11 fits, but was alittle tight, needed to wear a thin sock or no sock at all, size 12 fit abit loose, but comfortable, so I just wear a heavy hunting sock, ah toasty warm toes! If you normally wear size 9 1/2 shoe or boot, I would recommend size 11 ..... I bought 6 pair for presents during the holidays, everyone loved them!"
1,A Voice That SINGS!!!!!,What A Beautiful Voice Paired With GREAT Songs!! All In All Another Terrific Cd For Natasha!!!
0,BE VERY WARY OF THIS ITEM!!!!!!!,"I had my 2nd one (HLSU22003UC 20"" High Velocity Fan, 3 Speed, 23""x7""x23"", Chrome) for 3-4 days and it nearly caught fire. NO JOKE!!!! I had the speed set on high and the next thing I know was I heard the motor idling down all of the sudden to the lowest speed possible. I unplugged it immediately and good thing I did, because the motor was extremely hot, and I could smell something burning inside. I have owned 3 of these now in the last 2+ years. One just conked out 3-4 days ago after 2 year of use. Slightly different model than this one listed here though (Patton U2-1887 20-Inch High Velocity Whole-House Air Circulating Fan). Motor/Blades locked up on it. I now have the 3rd one up and running (Patton U2-2003-UC 20-Inch Velocity Air Circulating Fan) and will keep you posted on how this works out.P.S. I should also add that this particular fan/model once put together and running for the first time started making a humming noise right out of the box."
0,Unsatisfactory,"While the interface of the camera is professional looking, and the overall appearance of the camera is aesthetically pleasing, I was very disappointed with this camera. I noticed that the quality of the prints were very inferior to those taken by my friend's Nikkon Coolpix 3.2 mega pixel model. In addition, it was very hard to find a place to develop pictures, as most novice camera stores (and even some professional ones!) did not have machines that were compatible with the XD card (which by the way, costs almost double what any other memory card would cost).I accidentally dropped the camera once, and the LCD screen broke, and it no longer displayed images. Soon thereafter, the zoom broke, and the lens got stuck on the exterior of the camera. I threw it out, and got a Kodak EasyShare CX6330, which while not as aesthetically pleasing, takes much better pictures, and is far sturdier."
1,Christmas Gift,"I purchased this as a Christmas gift for my son, he has Season one.He really enjoyed Season one and I can't wait to give him this for Christmas."
0,Over-hyped,"This is ludicrous how so many reviewers are giving this album 5 stars. This spoiled bit*ch can't sign and is simply riding the coattails of her older and much more vocally talented sister Jessica Simpson. I've listened to this album and in addition to watching this show since I am a music talent scout for Sony and am appalled by the fact that my company tried to sign her. I've worked with Jessica and the talent differences are obvious. I give this album 2 stars due to the fact that Pieces of Me is a decently good song by the message she was getting across and not music talent and vocals. Please do not purchase but I encourage you to listen to a portion of ""Pieces of Me"" through this same exact web page. Try it out but I am almost positive you won't like it.Thanks"
0,CRAP,"Master P and all of no limit have no skill and just utter senceless words to make $$. Typical lazy, wanna be Dre rapper. No Limit will never be main stream and this is why cuz all they sing about is stupid things that make no sence and have no meaning to anyone. Save yourself the $ and go get Nelly's new LP."
0,Disappointment,"In over five years of transactions with Amazon, I've not been this disappointed at all. I ordered the stainless steel product displayed, but I kept receiving the aluminum product. This happened three times though I returned the merchandise with my reason clearly explained. I guess it's the age of machines for if a human eye had read my reason, there was no way s/he could have sent me the aluminum expresso maker three times.On balance, this is just a small event in my overall relationship as a customer, which I can certainly overlook. However, Amazon should look into this matter because even for them, this business plan is not at all efficient. Amazon incurred six shipping charges and didn't even make the sale."
0,DONT BUY,It wasnt what i thought it was. the metal part of the kit was bent and couldnt be fixed. Simple as this< it sucked.
0,"Caveat Emptor - This is Not a Subscription, It's a Rental Agreement","For all those of you who were, like me, considering replacing your subscription to the physical copy of the magazine with a Kindle supscription, think twice.As things are on April 28th 2011, you will not be able to keep your magazine collection anywhere else except on the Kindle, which will eventually fill your Kindle's memory and make it unusable for anything else.I believe that subscription means that every issue of the magazine I buy is mine to keep and store as I please. If there are restrictions to this, than I do not really own the copy. I own the right to keep it for a certain time. The fact that the lenght of this time period is not defined in time units, but rather in memory units, does not change the issue.I do not intend to purchase any subscriptions until this issue is resolved. Your move, Amazon."
0,Awful!,"This is the worst DVD I have ever bought. In fact, its IDENTICAL to another Avril Lavigne documentary called Skater Girl. They just slapped a new cover on it and changed the title. Its dated 2007 but there is nothing on it about her second or third albums, it tentatively ends in 2003. If its a recent vid how come its missing 4 years? And why have a recent picture of her as the cover photo?There is NO original Avril music or videos or concert footage. The background music is of artists I've never even heard of and they're really not very good. The interviews are with people that arent within Avrils inner circle and although it has some decent photos from before she made it big, it uses stock footage of interviews from the Let Go promo tour. They imply that she made a second album but dont even mention the name or a single song from it.DO NOT BUY THIS DVD!!!!!"
1,A book everyone should read,I purchased this book for a friend but ended up keeping it for myself and getting her another copy. I am a student of psychology and am always happy to find empirical data to back up theories on what makes us happy. I recommend this book to anyone who has doubts about the road they are travelling and who might be looking for a positive roadmap to a better place.
0,Misleading,"Each capsule is 500mg, but only 100mg of it is actually phosphatidylserine. This is very disappointing, since it seems to be difficult to find PS in amounts greater than 100mg."
1,"Not his best, but definitely an enjoyable read","My first taste of Harry Turtledove was ""Worldwar: In the Balance"", so I've come to expect a lot from him. This book (And in fact, ""How Few Remain"" as well) aren't quite as good as his ""Worldwar"" series, but it was nevertheless enjoyable. Parts of the book DID get somewhat tedious--mostly during the winter months when the fronts stalled completely and there was relatively little action--but for a history buff such as myself, the book was satisfying overall. Perhaps the best way of describing my reaction to it is simply this: I will be buying the hardcover version of the next book in the series as soon as it's available."
0,"Noisy, Low quality materials used throughout","Just finished removing this from my cabinets. I was too loud, we were afraid it would wake the kids.Additionally, it looks nice from a distance, but up close you can see the pitting and poor finish.The price was right, and we didn't expect much, but it just isn't something we can use."
1,Jax <3 er,Well I'm no true critic or anything but I have to admit that as soon as I received this box set it was the only thing in my DVD player for over a week.I love the casting and I think they work so well together.The hype for the season premiere was amazing! It was like the season opener for a NFL game or something!!!I hope this series lasts for a long time to come.The DVD set is amazing with all the extra footage...it's a must have!Amyzzz
0,Terrible,"The book contains left out diagrams, and incorrectly solved homework problems for starters. Also, the book has no solutions to the odd worked problems. Furthermore, the authors tend to give simple examples in the text and then give extremely difficult homework problems at the end of the chapter. Lastly, the book has a very bad and vague explanation for passive sign convention that will leave you suffering for the duration of the text.If you don't have a good instructor that is willing to fill in the gaps that this book leaves, then chances are you will do poorly in your first circuits class."
1,a must have,This is a must have dvd for any my chem fan. It really helps you to know and understand the band better. I wish they would come out with more dvd's like this one just current. I know a lot of fans would really enjoy that.
1,A book of characters that pull you into the secrets and lives.,"This wonderful book causes you to feel the full spectrum of emotions, happiness for them, heartbreak, outrage, frustration and sorrow to name just a few. It is because this wonder writer draws each so perfectly that we feel what they do. While angry at the percieved motivations of one, there is also the traits that allow you to understand how they may reason out their twisted behavior. I read this once a year and each time the ending takes my breath, makes me cry, makes me think about our own capacity to act in behalf of those we love in ways we can't begin to imagine unless necessity is forced upon us. Read this in the warmpth of summer by a lake or in the depth of winter by a fire. If you have a sister you love, keep her close in mind as you read this book. Enjoy!"
1,Wonderful book,The Outsiders is a wonderful book. My favorite part was when Ponyboy and Johnny saved those kids from the fire. They put aside the murder to saved the children in the burning church although they knew that the public would soon find out about the murder. What I did not like about this book was the ending. Although some socs and greasers were friends like Cherry and Ponyboy. I still wish that S.E.Hinton could have made the story end with a little more friendship between the greasers and the Socs.
0,Bad Rash,"I have been using the unscented deodorant for quite a couple years because I wanted a deodorant only (without an antiperspirant) and recently bought a new one. I had noticed the packaging was a bit different and that it said ""New and Improved"". Well as soon as I used it this time around, I got REALLY BAD red, blistery, weepy, itchy rashes under both armpits. This product is not safe and I can no longer use this product. I noticed a lot of other people are having problems as well. I am keeping it though in case I decide to have it tested. This product needs to be taken off the shelves! So much for the FDA I guess."
0,Not the best,"I have read almost every single one of Sandra Brown's books and this one is definately not one of the best. I felt that the conflict was ""resolved"" in a very unexciting fashion and that the entire book was just a string of loves scenes. I usually expect Brown to make the characters struggle with each other before falling in love. Arden and Drew were drawn to each other from the very beginning and although Arden's secret made her nervous throughout the book, she did not let it affect any of her decisions. I thought that the story and the logic behind the characters' actions did not make sense. If I have to recommend a Sandra Brown, it would be ""Led Astray"" or ""A Treasure Worth Seeking""."
1,Incredible,"This album is incredible. It's the best CD I own. The songs are exquisite, the lyrics are beautiful, and it's just as good at background noise as it is at a dance club. It's great."
1,Incredible!!,"... This book is excellent; definately one of the top three of the series. The action starts on page 1 and doesn't let up until the book is finished. Hunting For Hidden Gold has perhaps the best mystery out of all of the books in the series and is written quite well unlike most of the books put out after the early 1950s. The book is very exciting, as quite often Frank and Joe are chasing, or being chased by, the criminals. Definately one of the best, no Hardy Boys fan should miss this one."
1,Great weave of history and sci-fi!,"I see most of the reviews are positive but the couple that aren't mention the same thing - lack of antagonistic characters. Last I checked, there were more choices than man vs man in great literature. There is also man vs nature and that is what this is all about. Nature is personified as ""the past"" and it is up to the protagonists to conquer nature and change the future. One of Card's best, this one really left me pondering over the possible outcomes and paradoxes."
1,Heroine of the YEAR,"Meliara is such a new and fresh female to read about. We meet Meliara at the beginning of this tale as a teenage Countess who doesn't know how to act proper (because her father didn't want her to reach the same fate as her late mother did). Meliara knows very little of embroidery, dancing, and flirting with flirts, but has more knowledge in handling swords and reading long old scriptures. I can't wait to see how Meliara develops as a teenager into a young lady. If you have not read this book, but you decide you're going to, you're in for a real treat!"
1,Great!,"This product works out a lot of your stabilizer muscles, along with the big muscle groups of the pushup. The bar itself adds a few inches to your pushup so you can go down further and work your chest more. Great product and feels sturdy enough to last a few years."
0,Not that great,They are not very comfy or user friendly. It took me 10 min just to figure out how to put them on. I would look for something else.
1,worth watching once,"I did enjoy the slow burn of this film, the understated, almost leisurely approach to tension.But I checked out emotionally for the same reason that I check out emotionally from most films: when the behavior of the characters on the screen resembles in no way human behavior as I recognize it. In the case of this film, that happened when the guy was kissing the girl in the elevator, while the assassin was standing right there.Yeah, right."
1,Don't %@&*%$ With the Wongs,"A cult classic from the minute it hit cable, the music soundtrack came out amidst the New Wave music domination of 1979 and was promptly ignored. But the cream always rises to the top and this soundtrack is simply superb. This is a movie steeped in urban New York mythology.Not to be missed. The movie could double as a Sociology class on the immigrant New York experience as we watch the Irish, Italian, Polish, Black and Chinese youth struggle over their piece of the turf in the Bronx of 1963.The movie works on multiple levels -- unearthing a tender love and care for the Italian youth who comprise the gang of the Wanderers."
1,Great for co-sleeping,"We're sleeping with our baby and use this to position her between us at night. It works great because it elevates her just up to eye level, and it's soft enough that I can still snuggle up to her. I position the wedges nice and tight to her sides, so it gives us peace of mind knowing that she's sleeping in the right position. I know I may not be able to use it when she gets a bit older because she'll probably scoot down on it, but for now, it works great for us. And, for the price I feel it's worth it."
0,"This is ""new"" history?","This is a work of absurd fluff. This is WW2 from a solipsistic, silly All-American perspective that really is a fantasy. 600 pages of WW2 ""history"" with 45! count'em-45 pages on the Eastern Front where the bulk of WW2 was actually fought. Its the same old boring photos we've all seen mixed with a an even more jingoistic editorial slant than the old American Heritage WW2 History. A more appropriate title would have been Stephen Ambrose's WW2 Fantasy; no pesky Russkies in this story."
1,Great book to start with!,"This book gives you all the information you need for begining juice fasting and fasting. How much more do you need? What kind of ""advanced technique"" is there to not eating. It doesn't give detailed physyological information, but it isn't a medical book. It explains everyhting in a way that makes it easy to understand what you're doing, what is happening to your body, and how it helps."
0,Jump!,"I paid good money for this book so I've been trying hard to finish it these last couple of weeks. Hornby hasn't made it easy though. Lacking any of the charm found in his first book High Fidelity, this ponderous piece of garbage may well be one of the first books I have flung out the window in a long, long time. Such a shame too...High Fidelity, About A Boy...fine little reads..Too bad his last two efforts have been such stinkers, this one in particular. One star only because I know the guy can write. You would never know it , however, if this was the first book of his you had bought."
1,Reading for english class,This is a great book. it helped me for my class.it came quick and it was cheap.
1,Sherlock Holmes versus the Cthulhu!!,"I stumbled upon this book by accident and being a huge Sherlock Holmes fan as well as a huge Lovecraft fan I decided to pick it up. I was NOT disappointed. This Book is TERRIFIC!! Neil Gaiman's short story ""A Study in Emerald,"" alone is worth my money. Gaiman was able to capture Sherlock Holmes in a different light and still stay true to the character (that story had a lovely twist at the end).Most of the other stories are also wonderful with maybe one or two that lose the Holmes feeling to them. I like how Holmes was able to accept the possibility of other worldly creatures through the use of logic and deduction and that he knew of cults because cults are the cause of many a small murdering sprees and one has to keep up with that kind of information.I read the entire book in a span of three days and just devoured everything in it. This book made me want to go and read other Holmes pastiches!!"
1,"Quick service, fair price","One thing I love about this vacuum cleaner is that it has instructions to replace the belt, RIGHT next to the belt.Product was a fair price and arrived in a timely way, I bundled a few things so had few shipping.Saved me driving around looking for one and hoping it was in stock."
0,we get it already,"If you wish to learn something interesting re the fact that the keys of b minor and Bb major share the note D as their third, you would do far better to consult a decent recording of Beethoven's Hammerklavier Sonata than this navel-gazing narcissistic atrocity."
0,Disapointing,"When I heard that T.A. Baron was writting another book I was thrilled. I really enjoyed the Lost Years of Merlin series and was looking forward to another great read. However, I found this book to be poorly written. The diction was lacking and it sounded as if she made the names of the chracters up by scrambling as many letters as she could to make something that resembled a name. The story had a good plot though, and with some hard work could have been better."
1,Don't overlook this album!!,"Well, I am please to inform those of that are fans of the Beautiful South that this is a remarkable record considering Paul is on his own. The sound is that of the South and a little bit more. He seems to be experimenting with techno sounds on a couple of tracks, but not too much so that it makes you skip to the next song. I like most of the album and really really dig the rest. It is worth the import price. I should also mention that he seems to be trying out three new female vocalists here since the departure of Jackie a couple of years ago. Only one caught my attention, but they all serve his voice well. If you go to the French Amazon site , you may find it cheaper there. Good luck and enjoy."
0,Why the hell was this ever banned,"The cover of this movie states that it was banned in 31 counties. I want to know what countries. There is pretty much no reason why this flim should of ever been banned.I did slightly enjoy this film but it was not what I was expecting. I went into this film thinking it was going to be an awsome gore-fest, but I was wrong. Sure there were a few good scenes for all gore lovers to enjoy. Like the hooks through the boobs or the guy getting the top of his head sliced off and his brains eaten. But it is not worth sitting through a lot of boreing dilouge just to watch it. The actors in this film seemed to be slightly retarded, like if you see a dead body in a village of cannibals, why the hell would you decide to stay the night with them? Your just asking to be eaten."
1,amazing restoration,"I've owned the music on this set in a number of formats and collections. Some, though not all, of this music is as good as blues gets. But the sound on this latest restoration is far better than I imagined it could ever be. I hear things I never heard before. The 'Keep on Loving' track might even be a take I've never heard before. Highly recommended; replace your Cobra box with this and the Magic Sam Essential Collection released at the same time."
1,Great Book,Needed this book to teach a lesson. It is a great book and received it in a timely matter.
1,BIG ASS 112FAN!!,"This by far is THE BEST 112 Album. I own all the rest but this one is the only one that i can actually sit and listen to the whole cd witout skipping to the next song. In my opinion, the best songs on here are: Smile,I Think, Still In Love, Don't Hate me,(but Twista kinda f*cks up the song)and Missing you. Even the interludes were good and usually on other albums they get on my nerves. But anyway Overall I give it 5/5."
1,Great family fun,"I recently set up my playstation and two DDR pads on the linoleum in my dining room when my niece, her cousins and their friends were invading me for the day. The good news: The girls, all ages 9-12, couldn't get enough. The bad news: We couldn't get them to stop, even with a large, warm, crystal blue swimming pool outside.If you are the parent or aunt/uncle of tweens, this is a great game to buy. Make sure and buy *TWO* dance pads for it. However, make sure it is set up somewhere such that the adults can escape! After you've heard the Mickey Mouse Club extended Techno Rave mix 11 times in a row (because the girls *have* to get a AAA score before moving on) it will get old. It is hard to find a game that children will play, is safe, and will give them a real aerobic workout. This game is all that!"
1,wonderfull!,"i got these stars for my new room and there are plenty to make a decent sized room sparkle, i'm 18 and i love these stars and so does my boyfriend :) we put them up on valentines day and did 2 full constellations plus there were extra to scatter :) they glow bright and look like twinkling stars, they shine longer then the pack said and bring me great joy <3"
0,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED AND MISLED,"As a Christian, I was very offended by the views and statements in this book. Sue Patton Thoele (author) states in this book...""Is it possible that we are made in the image of a Mother God, a feminine creator, a divine spiritual essence? We're beginning to accept the answer as yes.""Sue continues to lead her readers into using the divine feminine within and uses what SHE calls ""prayer"" as a means of overcoming negative emotions. This ""prayer"" is either directed inward to oneself or to a Mother/Father God, not to God in heaven.To top it all off, she has one of her chapter topics labeled ""bitch"". I know that the same points in this section could be made in a much more tasteful way.If you are considering this book and have any belief in God whatsoever, you may be offended as I was and be very disappointed that you wasted your time and money."
1,HDScape's best release yet!,"Stargaze HD looks to offer stunning views of outer space. While it is true these are only still images which are panned around and accompanied by music, the images are very captivating in nature and the panning motion is enough to keep the program interesting and moving along.Unlike most of HDScape's other titles, Stargaze HD looks virtually free of compression artifacts. Some of the HDScape titles look very rough with obvious macroblocking, but this title gets the job done.Recommended for fans of space! :)"
1,Enlightening & Provocative,"Tim Binding's book sets as its scene the German occupation of Guernsey during the Second World War. The people, who differ from the mainland English due to their former French identity, are made to live with their occupants in 'harmony'. This is something that some characters find easy to do while others struggle at it. Some, however, do it for convenience and to raise their social standing. The novel questions the moral decisions these characters make in a world which is distorted and unreal, making the entire question of morality warped as the island is camptured in a time when nothing feels real. What the would have decided at peacetime is not something they will opt for in times of trouble. Binding's novel is illuminating in exploring the human condition, and the prioritisation of values which bring out the true nature of a human being in crisis. A good read."
0,Good brand but manufactured in China,"The design is good but quality of workmanship is lower than the ones made in Finland. Should be good for a few runs. Fiskars should make more in Finland even at higher retail price.Edit: weeble wobbles. Don't like this at all. Not representative of other Fiskars stuff, which are generally high value good stuff."
0,Very unhappy,"I bought this bike in Mid February 2006 and after about a month the fan stopped working. I called Nautilus and they back ordered a computer console for the bike. It took over two months for the console to arrive. Now after another couple of months, I get the error message ""E-2"" and nothing works at all. Now, I have to join a local excercise club to use their bike(s) until I have managed to do something with this bike. All I know is, I can't afford to keep fixing this one all the time and Amazon won't give me a full refund."
1,A magical journey,"This is one rare movie which combines almost all of the genres of movies in one. It is full of spectacular sets, action, morals, and inspiration. Want to have a fun time? Go ahead and hit the play button!"
0,Poor design and finish!,"The tension rods did not hold their tension, and the rubber slipped on my bathtub tile walls, so the rod would not stay up properly. And in twisting the rods to increase tension, the only thing that really happened was that the rubbing process scratched the finish on both rods. Then I couldn't get the little plastic washers to fit as they're supposed to between the space of the tension rod segments. What a waste of $40! The stainless steel single rod I bought at the local discount shop for $7.99 has a better stainless steel finish, stronger tension, and is far easier to put up. Just put 2 up side by side - same effect as this ""award winning designed"" product."
0,I guess Madgeepoop is a has-been,"I can't believe Madgeepoop is a fool. The Last 5 star reviewer is ridiculous and he doesn't know what a wop is a slang for. Anyhow, this song does stink. Avoid this dog like a plague and go for The Best of The Tijuana Toads instead."
0,It's Okay,"I wasn't a huge fan of this book. It does have SOME useful information, but for the most part, I was very bored."
1,Very good,"Oh my God ,it is so good, it makes my long hair very smooth, and in the mean time it keeps my hair volume as it is. All my old make my hair thin , and I get annoyed. This Conair Flat Iron 2"" Ceramic Straightener is much better than the expensive brands. And I Im lucky ,because it is dual voltage as I m living in New Zealand 230V . it really worth . Thank you AMAZON."
0,Not Satisfied!,Faulty product. Not what was advertised in the description. Very dissatisfied with what I received.Poorly packaged. Discolored.
1,Okay,In good condition but took nearly a month to receive. Seller did not send item until a week after he was paid in full. Finally received and it was in good shape.
1,Excellent Movie!,Great original screenplay. Exciting plot and good acting. I was glued to this one. Mike Cohen is a genius! A must see!
0,Seeing demons where none exist,"As an Indian-American, I am totally disappointed with this book. Apart from terrible typos, the book also suffers from terrible imagination. At a time when the relationship between India and US is getting better, the trade is growing and they are both getting closer in terms of their world-perspectives, the author's attempts to paint India as villian is not just inexplicable, but downright dishonest. He does the world a disservice by painting one-sixth of humanity as bad guy. If you must buy this, do so to laugh at the author. Also keep in mind that characters and storyline are figment of the author's demented imagination."
0,Thousands of pages of the same point.,"I was given this book as a gift by a friend of mine. I don't like not finishing books that I start, although this one truly tested my commitment. I found the book extremely boring. It keeps repeating the same point over and over again, literally for over a thousand pages. I fail to see why this book is so popular. It didn't really change my point of view, but it did bore me a great deal and I was happy when it was finished."
0,Angie Houseman Abduction,"The information published in Through the Window by Diane Fanning regarding the abduction of Angie Houseman is incorrect. Angie Houseman was abducted from St. Ann, Missouri, not O,Fallon. There is a 20 mile difference in the locations of these two towns. This information should be verified for accuracy before being printed.I have not read the book. I came across the information about Angie Houseman while looking to see if there was any new information regarding her case on the internet. Sadly her murder remains unsolved 14 years later."
0,Cheaply Made - Poor Design,"My son's fish tank has never had so much algae since we switched to using this type of filter. There's no 'frame' surrounding the sponge to keep it in place and on top of that, it's made of two separate pieces that are not even connected together and you have to fiddle with it over and over to get it to stay in place. Even then, it still can move around or even dislodge completely. These have to be replaced constantly, nearly every week. I would strongly suggest looking into something that's made better and more substantially."
0,Difficult to understand dialogue,"The story was ok, but I couldn't understand the dialogue. I'm not sure if it was due to the accents or low gruff voices, but I could only follow about half the dialogue."
0,"Good image quality, sounds really bad","I don't know what made Dream Theater change the previous dvds sound editing formula, but this is really far away from the Budokan dvd. Is it only in my case or drums are totally low, I can't even distinguish what Mike is hitting. Guitar is really loud. I had high expectancy on this dvd because of the songs list and the fact that it would be orchestrated. Now I know that the Budokan dvd remains the best."
1,Great Sequel,"Touching Darkness (book #2) picks up immediately after the events from The Secret Hour (book #1). Therefore, if you haven't yet readMidnighters #1: The Secret Hour, read that book first.Touching Darkness adds some wrinkles to Jessica Day's newly discovered world - both in the secret hour and out. The backstory and history of the town of Bixby, previous midnighters, and the whole midnighter lore is more fully revealed to us. The history ties in with the current crisis and helps to drive the fast pace of the story.Overall, this was another very fast read that keep me up reading well into the night - how appropriate!"
0,Clock looses time !!,I bought six of these. Two of them lose several hours on the clock each day. I must reset the clock each day to keep them functioning on a schedule.
0,Review on CHI 1 inch Ceramic flat Iron bought from The Beauty Shelf,"My roommate has this flat iron and it is awesome but the one I got didn't work properly (it didn't get hot enough). So, I returned it and Amazon reimbursed me."
1,Good basic keyboard and mouse,I was looking for an affordable but reliable keyboard. Logitech was an obvious choice for me since I've always been satisfied with their products. The keyboard is very basic but has dedicated multimedia and web keys which are really handy. The keys are not low profile but are quiet and feel nice. The mouse is pretty small but works fine and has back/forward buttons as well as a tiltable/clickable scroll wheel. Overall this is a quality product that I would recommend for any home user.
1,"Compelling and thought-provoking, but flawed.","The Sixth Sense is one movie that draws you into its web, and won't let you out until you've devoted a lot of mental time and energy to it. I'm not, however, sure all the work is richly rewarded. Haley Joel Osment and Toni Collette give powerful performances, but Bruce Willis's central performance is lacking, and drags most of his scenes down with it. The movie feels like it truly needed a much stronger actor and a more compelling presence at its core, and it would really have given the movie much more emotional weight. The DVD version includes some great extras, and is a must-have for every movie enthusiast. The VHS version, missing the additional enhancements, is still worthwhile, but not essential. Regardless, The Sixth Sense is still entertaining, and worth sitting through once or twice, but probably not much more."
0,disappointed in the GOLD DEAL,"Ive look at the reviews, and this switch seems to be good compare with other for the price. I was a little disappointed in the gold deal by amazon. If you search newegg you will find this available cheaper (37.99 shipped AR)and you dont have to hurry to order it within the four hour ""SPECIAL"".Some dont like the review caz i mainly took into account the price. sorry to bad, price is a killer for me. ""GOLD DEAL"" should mean something."
1,Not a bad read for sci-fi,"As a teacher of eighth grade English, I make it a point to keep up with young adult literature. I found this book by Shusterman to be very entertaining and compelling, until it got to the end. I felt that at the end it all kind of fell apart and became truly unrealistic. I am writing this review to show my sixth period class how to do an online review. I think it's an excellent way for students to do real-world publishing and share their opinions with others."
0,Uck! With a capital U,"I'm not a squeamish person. I often enjoy dark fiction and seldom read anything other than SF. BUT, I found this book repelent. I've tried to read it 2 or 3 times but it makes my skin crawl and not in a good way. I've never gotten beyond the first few chapters. If you decked to read it, good luck."
0,I think they blew it,"Yes, the design is too large for normal ears, and there is no way to get these things comfortable. In addition, there is no volume control on these which is a real disadvantage on my Sync where the only settings are too darn quiet and way too loud. I am still searching for a better solution, but like others have said, Samsung has limited choices by using a proprietary plug. Too bad, because the phone itself is pretty good."
0,Terrible,"Day 1 - The fan works OK and the laptop still gets warm, but not hot.Day 2 - Fan becomes so noisy I only use it if the laptop gets hot.Day 3 - IT DOESN'T TURN ON ANYMORE.Even if it actually had lasted for more than 3 days, the wire connecting to the USB port got in the way of the fan, and the place where my laptop gets hot is in the top left corner, while the fan mainly cools the keyboard area. Useless. Luckily, I got it as a gift, so I didn't waste any money on it.Basically, don't buy it."
1,"Good, I like it","The tone block I received was not the same color. Perhaps I missed the disclaimer ""colors may vary"" but really, my son doesn't much care what color it is. Also, the tone block I received did not come with a mallet. It came with a small stick that functions, but not as well as a mallet would."
1,Thrilling end!,"Marvellous job tying all the pieces together. Wish it never ended, but this is definitely the best ending to any series I've ever seen."
1,I LOVE THIS MASK!,"I ride my bicycle to work and back (23 miles round trip) and in the mornings I start out at 6 AM, when it's around 30 degrees out. I wear this mask, a cycling jersey, arm warmers, cycling shorts or tights, and socks and shoes for clip ons.This cycling mask reduces the runny nose by damn near 100%. I wear it just like the picture, with my nose covered. No problems at all with breathing. And because you don't have that awful fleece material inside, your mouth and nose never get uncomfortable. Perfect material. Lightweight, so it's no big deal if you're wearing it while the weather warms. Easy enough to pull down while riding if you want to spit. Easy enough to put on some sunglasses through the hole on the sides (though I don't ride that way, considering it's still dark when I ride in the morn).If you're looking for something to shield your face, ears, nose from the cold and you don't want fleece innards, get this mask! I'm thinking about getting four more of these."
1,A multi-layered treasure,"I very much enjoyed reading ""The Sabbathday River"" by this author a few years back, so I grabbed this book when I saw it in the store. ""The White Rose"" is very different from her last novel, but just as good if not better. This is a multilayered story that keeps the reader digging for more--just when you think you have it figured out, the plot takes a different direction. The characters are well-drawn and believable--some likeable, some not. The descriptions of New York City society are good and the historical details a nice addition. I'll be thinking about this book for awhile."
0,"Could be better,but OK","What I like...the attached storage cord that fits in the phone jackWhat I do not care for...for my hand, I wish the stylus was longer. Also, the tip of the stylus sometimes does not work well and you have to press extra hard on the screen or repeated times.For the cost, not a bad deal. If you want a premium stylus be prepared to invest more than a couple of dollars."
1,Shade!,"If you own this generation of Civic, you've probably realized it has a freaking huge windshield. Even jumbo shades weren't enough to fit mine. This does the job very nice...keeps out the sun and heat.I'd give it 5 stars if it fit around the review mirror better, but I just let mine hang by the sunshades a bit."
1,GOOD AMERICAN STANDARD,"Pros: A good book full of suspense and a sympathetic female main caracter in a technical environment. I had fun to read it in a few days. Like in his best novel (Disclosure) Crichton provides (or seems to provide) some inside aspects of professional life in technical companies. Moreover, when looking at recent news, parts of the plot have become reality. Cons: Crichton's language and his dramatic means are limited. You find repeats of certain phrases a bit too often within the text."
1,Redeeming Love,"The book is probably my favorite of all time. It is heart-wrenching, and there are times I didn't think I could get through it. But I pushed through an dam SOO glad I did. WOW this is an amazing writer and has created characters and a story line that I will never, EVER forget."
1,Culture at its best,"This is an amazing book, practically one of a kind! The information, illustions, and luster of the indigenous African cultures is beautiful to behold. I recommed introducing young children to cultures and peoples as varied as the come to fully portray to them the true beauty of this creation, life. There is nothing so intricate, so inveloping and powerful as life in this form. Pronounciation is given for the tribes names to bring ease of reading, which is, in fact, very enjoyable."
0,only works if it stays plugged into port,"If your usb slot/port is vertical, you may have trouble with this. Because of the adapters bulkiness, combined with the weight of the cable you plug into it, the adapter keeps loosening from the usb port."
0,Wireless weather station,"If you live in a warm weather climate, this is probably a good product. For those of us who live in the northern part of the country however, it doesn't stand the test. To be fair, it states in the directions that alkaline batteries will likely freeze below 20 degrees, but of course you need to purchase the product to find this out. The consumer has the option of purchasing lithium batteries, but they are harder to find. I would recommend this product"
1,Seems to work,"I used this spray to help stretch a few pair of leather shoes. It worked fine. In all, it just smells like rubbing alcohol and water which would probably have done the same."
0,This is not the original movie: million eyes of Sumuru,"This movie is incredibly slow, unexciting and dull.I have bought it because I saw a couple of scenes from ""million eyes of sumuru"" and stupidly thought that ""thegirl from rio"" was just a new title given to an old movie, million eyes, in fact.as this is not the case and for some odd reason ""million eyes of sumuru"" is not available on DVD or VHS I suggest you to lobby for the issue of million eyes better than buying this stupid movie."
0,A nightmare,"I have never read a book with such depressing, perverted and unredeemable characters. Ms MacDonald writes well but her subject matter is horrifying and the stuff of nightmares. I realize there are pedophiles on this earth and I know incest exists but why does she have to write of it under a pretext of a novel about family? This isn't a family I wanted to know about. If I had only been warned! My copy went to the Goodwill."
1,Good Product,This is an exact replacement unit; straightforward job. One nice change is the tension relief access. The original required that the engine be lowered 50 - 60 mm in order to insert the tool and relieve tension on the belt. Next belt replacement will not require it.
1,We need help!,"My wife and I watched this movie on a taped, delayed basis today. The tape turned off as the two stars were leaving the cemetery with the dog. What happened next or was that the end?"
0,mold. ugh!,"OK, I've tried this sprouter 3 times now, and each time the sprouts develop mold on about the third day. Definitely not acceptable. I've even sanitized the unit in the dishwasher, and am using filtered water, all with the same results. Time, money and moldy spouts all down the drain."
0,Not very enlightening,"I expected more given the 5 star reviews. There is no instruction, just a quick over view of the parts of the vaginathen 30 minutes of watching an attractive woman rubbing her clit very lightly. If you have never seen a vagina then this has about 5 minutes of content and the rest is pretty much a waste. I would like to give it 1/2 star."
0,dull and dull--save your money,"The original, ""The Book of the Dead"", to which this is a sequel, is much better simply because at least 2 stories somewhat approach what most of us want in survival horror. I won't repeat what I wrote there (feel free to check out my review), but this book isn't worth the time or money. The stories are far too cutesy, as though, in trying to present new perspectives, every writer drew from the same cliched examples.Nothing here as cool as the terrific ending to Resident Evil (the movie), the tunnel scenes in The Stand, or the Manhattan scenes in Swan Song--and the last 2 aren't even zombie stories! A better book--though much harder to find--might be Bryan Keene's The Rising.Certainly a much scarier book is Noel Hynd's Ghosts.Avoid these 2 books--The Book of the Dead and Still Dead. Not only are they not scary--they're dull!"
1,Beautiful Book About a Beautiful Lady and Her Clothes,"If you enjoy fashion and Jacqueline Kennedy, then you will most likely enjoy this book. It is intersting to see Mr. Cassini's sketches next to the actual pictures of the garments. It is a coffee table type book that one would enjoy flipping through causally and not one that I would say one would want to read word for word like a novel."
1,Decent fit but could be a little longer,"The fit was as stated and the fabric wasn't too suffocating. I felt comfortable in this get-up but I needed to wear a grey skirt in addition because it was a little too short for public dressup ;) A couple of inches would have made me more comfotrable when sitting or bending over or doing anything in this ""dress"". Good price and fun accessories as well."
1,great read!,I thought this book was exceptional. I was shocked by the ending and found it very clever. The details of the characters situation and conditions were heart wrenching. Great story by Elizabeth Flock. This was the first time I read a book by this author. The book was passed on to me by a co-worker.
1,"Great PU, no hum","Dropped these into a MIM Strat. No hum and retained the classic strat quack and clarity. They're sensitive to height adjustments, so tweak 'em to taste. I tried the Dimarzio Area pu's and lost some of the signiture Fender quack and clarity. I prefer these. If you want the Fender sound, then buy Fender pu's. Lesson learned."
1,Just what I was needing!,"We bought this to use in our daughter's bath tub. She has a ton of toys and this is perfect storage during and after bath time. Seems pretty sturdy, but I could see some of the other reviews points...if your child was to try to stand on it or something of that nature, it would most likely break. But then again, it's not made for that! :-) Overall great product and works wonderfully!"
0,Total Garbage,This book was written on Speculation and the intent to further the author's career. And Suddenly now the author is a Huge Celeb on the cover of Tv Y Novelas and everything. But at the cost of Selena's reputation.
0,Sony Cable,"It does not work very well on my DVD player, and there were some significant damages on it"
1,"Smooth sound, nice vocals",Nice hypnotic music with a little complexity and some great vocals thrown in.
1,A good album from an incredible band,"Counting Crows is one of the best bands out there - both live and on cd. Hard Candy is a wonderful album, but it cannot compare to August and Everything After. Either way, Hard Candy is a must-have for any Counting Crows fan."
1,"if showing to students, beware","This movie is excellent; however, if showing to school students - note that there is nudity in the section called ""back to school."" Educators may want to preview before showing."
1,Very Comfortable,"I intentionally bought this product a little small and the compression works wonderfully to restrain a heavy load. Wearing this, I feel secure and mostly... don't think about that area during my daily routine and that just wasn't the case with other solutions tried before that tended to loose elasticity and hold. Very comfortable."
0,"Slow, slower, slowest","Longest Adagio, I have ever heard. Endless. Perfect for funerals.The rest is average to say the least."
1,NIV Application Bible,"I love my hard copy of the Life Application Bible, but wanted a smaller version to carry with me. It was wonderful to be able to download the Kindle Ap to my iPhone and get this wonderful translation of God's Word with valuable commentary right at my fingertips at all times."
0,Not a fan!,"This product is great in theory, but very impractical. the ""straps"" that wrap around the baby's arms are way to thick and bulky and so it bunches up underneath the baby and isnt comfortable. This swaddle also leaves the baby's legs way too much room to kick around and wake themselves up. It is aso tedious to have to unwrap this in the middle of the night to change a diaper. I was very dissappointed with this product so I returned it"
0,Good idea but breaks easily,These blocks are a unique idea but after a while the springs start falling out of the blocks. My son did not find them as exciting has I thought he would because they would pop open before he could finish building anything. Great idea but poorly executed. For the money they are an interesting block to add to his building materials.
0,"Poorly written, bad examples, error ridden = Waste!","This is the worst technical book I have ever had the misfortune to read. I was originally excited to purchase the book as the Table of Contents outlined topics I am interested in studying. However, the book is riddled with text and code errors. In fact, the author had the audacity to change the downloadable source code after the book was published. Therefore, you can't even get the code source for the examples in the book, and the new code comes with no instructions! In addition, the author does a poor job of explaining the concepts he is trying to teach. M&T Books should be ashamed for publishing this poorly edited text. I truly feel that I have been swindled by this company/author and would like a full refund. The book is so bad that I will avoid all M&T Books in the future."
1,much cheaper at Toys R Us,This swing sells at Toys R Us for $22.99. Not sure why it's so much here? Great swing though and would definitely recommend for 1 year and up!
1,Star celebrates Girls Night Out,"If you enjoy a fast, funny, smart, how-to book, then Shine is perfect. Star celebrates the joy of finding happiness in the moment. Star celebrates her relationship with God and lives the scripture to 'eat, drink and be merry';for this is a gift from God. Thanks for the reminder Star."
0,Ha Ha!! a Greatest Hits Already???,"don't you have to have some sort of Musical Talent to Merit a Greatest Hits?? don't you have to have at least One song that Counts to have had a hit??Hilary Duff&Lindsey Lohan are basically the same person&I bet Cash Money that Lohan's Greatest Hits Package is coming soon as well.Hilary Duff ain't showed me much as Music Artist,as a Actress, as a Tv Actress,etc....but hey if you can get over with two Albums&drop a Greatest Hits pacakge then more power to you,but how about a Greatest Hit???"
1,WHY ARE PEOPLE HATING,"I love this cd. I cant find anything wrong with it. Teairra has a nice voice and she sings her lil booty off. I personally love the old school type singers like anita baker, regina belle, tina marie, etc, but this cd really caught me. Its what in the same category that people put ciara in crunk n blues. I love it. PLease dont listen to all these haters, oo she curses, so what? What teenager doesnt curse? What adult doesnt curse? She does it with realness not just to say it for the wow effect. Buy this cd you wont regret it.And for those that didnt know ol girl is from detroit, my old stomping grounds."
1,Inspired Album,"Vinson Valega has successfully translated the distinct passion and atmosphere of his live sets into a great debut studio recording. Textures abound. Long & Wrong is an outstanding track: picture a lonely East Coast storyteller recounting a particularly dark and dusty tale from a long ago journey through the desolate back roads of Nevada, where code rules, not law. Stumble Monk, a real bouncer, nods to a great Jazz master and features some of Valega's best percussion patterns. Consilience is a memorable debut. And for anyone interested in a critical dialogue about the times in which we live, visit the Consilience Productions website for an array of well-prepared social responsibility information. You can sign up for their newsletter as well."
0,Our entire book club couldn't get through this book!,"My book club is made up of well-educated and well-read people. A few read and loved Chabon's previous work. NONE of us could make it through this book. It seemed overly wordy, complex, and indirect. One third through this book we still couldn't figure out what it was about and why we should care about the characters. And, if you don't know Yiddish words, you're hopelessly lost. We can't figure it out: why does everyone else rave about this byzantine and plot-less book? Maybe if we stuck it out past the first half, it would have redeemed itself?"
1,AMAZING (:,"I love christian movies, or movies that have a powerful Godly message behind them, and I have seen a lot of christian movies, and this is 1 of the best I have seen so far, granted it was filmed in the 80's or early 90's but it is still AMAZING none the less. I think this movie is a lot like Fireproof- a christian message around a couple in love.I don't want to give too much away, but the main character Craig is a christian young man that is looking for more in life than just the ordinary. He then meets the girl that will become the love of his life... the story evolves around them. He teaches her things, but the most important the true way to salvation, and encourages her to have a relationship with God.I highly recommend this film for anyone looking for a good Christian love story... and like the other reviews mentioned.. you will probably cry like my friends and I did!"
0,Waste of time and money.,"This book was sent as a free gift when I ordered a cookbook through the mail. I'm glad it was free because I nearly threw it out! I later sold it at a garage sale. Each page is a one line quote from various Weight Watchers leaders, members, etc. It's a nice idea, but not a very helpful tool. Very out of character for Weight Watchers, as their cookbooks are all wonderful!"
1,Very different from traditional straps and backstrap,"I wasnt sure how I would like these when first putting them on but after playing for a short time I found them to be very secure and comfortable. The padded sections also have a non slip material which makes a back strap almost unnecessary. Ths straps have a stretchiness to them which also helps the instrument feel very secure. And for the price, they are a great value. How they wear and last remains to be seen but worth a try for any player I think."
0,Crappiest Media Made,I bought these disks hoping they would be good like other ridata purchases before hoping the media code was RICOHJPN media which is good media for its price but instead i get RITEK-R03-02 8X rejects sold as 4X with terrible quality and im stuck with 200 of them. And I am not happy at all!!

1,great value,"Bought as a gift for my mother to put under kitchen cabinet. Installation was quick and painless, and mom was cooking while listening to her favorite CDs in no time."
1,a great western/romance,"I've read the first 4 in the Cowboys series and look forward to the next ones. Leigh Greenwood is a great storyteller. His westerns are balanced between the cowboy adventure and the sensual romance. So far, Ward is my favorite, but it's a close call. If you haven't read the others, start right now with Jake and read them in order. I intend to re-read them. These are keepers."
0,Predictable,"this book is a romance novel which happens to have a long, drawn out, immature plot. The charactors are too perfect, their hokey methods are too on-the-money; nothing appears real.Memo to the author: if you want to write a romance novel, write a romance novel.. all the games the charactors played in their 'heads' were too much.murder mysteries make great entertaining reading; but when mixed with romance, it takes the edge (you so despartly want) away,out"
1,"A Classic, Intimate Portrait","This is a fantastic unplugged album, though it was recorded well before the unplugged idea came into being. There are probably four or five essential tunes here, including versions of The Who classics ""Bargain,"" ""Drowned,"" and ""The Seeker."" Those tunes barely prepare you for the stellar version of Townshend's ""Let My Love Open the Door,"" which appeared on his Empty Glass album about the time this set was recorded. In between those highlights, Rudd provides some really fine moments on the harp. The insightful, occasionally intimate ramblings of Townshend between songs adds to the value of this package. The primary flaw is the distortion we sometimes hear coming from Townshend's guitar...this is bothersome, not a deal killer. Essential for all serious Who/Pete Townshend fans."
1,Handy little device,I think this is a very user-friendly tuner with a lot of cool extras. I bought one for myself and one for a friend months later. We both love it!
0,"Bad, Bad, Bad.","One of these went bad on me after less than a month. There are metal contacts in the base that rust very quickly, and need almost daily maintenance to keep working. There is also a very small piece of plastic on the lip of the water tank that pushes a little recessed switch on the base that prevents it from running when the tank isn't connected. It is (and was) very easily broken, and no amount of superglue would keep it from breaking repeatedly - it's just too fragile. The thing won't run without it unless you figure out a way to jam something in there as a temporary fix. Thankfully, the store I bought it from took it back. If only I had read the reviews here first, I would have the inconvenience."
1,Comments about Motorola MD671,From my point of view it is a great product. It is a mid size phone you can easily carry wherever you go all over your home.Fully recommended.
1,Good Read,"I bought this for a upper level poly sci class and it is one I will be keeping in my collection. If you want to gain an understanding of the office of the President of the United States, how it really works and how the men who have held the office have shaped and molded the institution, this is the book to read."

1,Freedoms just another word for nothing left to loose,Sandrine Bonnaire is flawless in her performance. This movie will haunt you whenever you have the urge to chuck it all and hit the road.
0,No improvement,"I'm unimpressed with this new version of Scrabble. It looks nearly exactly like v2.0 (and only has one additional mini-game). More problematically, the game still runs full screen -- why can't I buy a Scrabble game that lets me play in a reasonably-sized window?? Also, like previous versions, you have to have the CD in your drive to play -- annoying for those of us who want to play on our notebook computers."
1,The Best Of The Bunch,"South Saturn Delta gives you a inside look at Hendrix's unreleased studio work. It's always a pleasure listening to new released music that over the years has been sitting at the vaults. As many do know Jimi Hendrix did over hundreds of recordings during his short lifetime. South Saturn Delta is worth a buy for a Jimi Hendrix fan. This is really great work done by the man himself Jimi Hendrix. The coolest recordings on this album is Message To Love, and Little Wing. This is a great album five stars of unreleased material."
0,running with scissors,The book running with scissors was about agusten burroughs crazy child hood. Augusten goes from living with both of his parents to living in the house of his mothers pyscatrist and theres lots of crazy stuff in bettween. i disagreed with the critics rateing of this book. The book was on the new yorks best sellers list for 70 weeks and i thought it was lucky the book got published. I didnt think the book really had hte edge to make you not want to put it down. I also didnt care for the writing style of the author. Unfourtunitaly the cover of the book with a boy with a box on his head is about as intresting as the book gets.
0,FinePix 2650 Do Not Buy This Camera,"When I bought the camera it was a good buy for the money, considering features. I've never been impressed with the photo quality though. This model is too fragile... drop it once and it is dead! The lens just broke off of mine following a mild bump -- the quality of the mount was far poorer that what I'de expect in a camera costing half the price. I have a friend whose FinePix 2650 died in a similar manner. Look elsewhere for a more durable camera."
1,Downshift Review,"This is one of the better deluxes to come out of the Cybertron line. He has a very nice vehicle mode, though with fairly questionable colors. In robot mode, his head sculpt pays a nice homage to the G1 character ""Wheeljack"". Cannons can be attached to his shoulders, giving him a very powerful look. His cyberkey gimmick allows a really cool-looking claw to pop out of the car grille. This gimmick works in both modes, but looks better in car mode. My only gripe is that the arms are a little short.PS: The product image has him mis-transformed: that panel snaps onto the bottom of his chest."
0,amazing amount of shrinkage,"Levi's Men's 501 Original FitI have worn Levi jeans for about 30 years. I have never had any even come close to the amount of shrinkage as in the pair of Levi's that I purchased through Amazon. I never got to wear them a single time. I tried them on the day that they arrived and they fit perfectly-just the size I ordered. I hung them in my closet for about a month, took them out and ran them through a COLD water wash. I let them tumble in the dryer for about 10 minutes and them line dried the for the rest of the day. I cannot even get them on. I tried to give them to my son who wears a 34 waist ( the jeans are 36 waist) but he can't get them on either. They now measure 33 at the waist. TOTALY RIDICULOUS !!!They are about 2 inches shorter than before they were washed in the cold water. I would usually give Levi jeans a high reccomendation but not these. It must be some wierd fabric from a different supplier."

1,Inspirational pc book for kids,"Definitely a book to own for kids pc artist. You may not be able to recplicate 100%, but this book surely gives ideas to kids.Let me describe this way. My 7 year old native Chinese boy does not read English (yet), but he manages to create his versions of characters out of the book - just by looking at the pictures.We're going to build our story scenario out of our creations soon. I'm happy with my purchase."
0,Yawn...,"I took the gamble and purchased this CD because of some of the positive reviews that it was given. I'd never heard of Morphine but it felt like it was a worthy risk. I gotta admit I was disappointed. I just couldn't find much substance in the lyrical or instrumental composition. I listened to it many times hoping that I might discover some subtle appeal, but nuttin...I found it empty and boring."
0,"Fun, but no masterpiece.","This book is easy to read, fun and flows well. That's about it. There is some modest success at character development, but nothing to shout about. Worth reading for the fun. Don't have high expectations. Not as interesting or exciting as THE HOT ZONE."
0,Quilt rack is extremely disappointing,Terrible!!! Screws stripped with the first few turns and were impossible to insert. The rack can not be assembled with the hardware provided.
0,"LAST SLICE OF PIE, PLEASE!","I have seen one other film in the AP series, and I am not very pleased with the movies. Now to set the record straight I love teenage sex comedies. However, a boy making love to a PB&J is not in my realm of humor. Toss in a dog and his brother filming the event and I am out the door. The movie missed a golden opportunity in The Book of Love. It attempted to reunite certain characters from the past to the present. We had Booger, from the classic ""Revenge of the Nerds"" as a teacher and Rosanna Arquette from ""Amazon Women on the Moon."" This should have been a parade of champions from past teenage sex comedies, instead we just get a few to tempt us. Nudity, sexual situations and non-stop crude sex language. Degrading to women, men, and dogs. Funny at times but not worth the coin."
1,Disgaea - the complete series,"I don't do games and I'm not familiar with the entertainment, but from somewhere, an advertisement for this series appealed to me. That in itself is unusual, because sadly, anime commercials nearly always fail to sell their product. This one looked a little quirkey, a little rude, and a bit on the fast-paced side, so I took a chance on it. I am glad I did. Disgaea is a fun series, full of demons who aren't quite as bad as they might be, angels and heros who aren't as good as they should be, and worlds we all can relate to. The story is nothing new, but the presentation is well done and the tale is a good one. If you like sarcastic comedy with anti-heros and anti-villians mixing it up for the sake of their own views and goals, Disgaea will entertain you."
1,Fantastic Live Performer.,"I saw David on this tour in 1981 and it is still one of the best live shows I have ever seen. All the songs on this cd are fantastic, but the David Johansen Group Live Cd is actually a better overall performance and a better value at over 30 minutes longer."
1,Unforgetable,"I saw this movie at the New Yorker Cinema back in the early 1970s. I will never forget the wailing chant: ""Zushio.....Anju.....Zushio.....Anju....."" I am pleasingly surprised to see it in a top 10 list"
0,BAD TRANSFER,"The two stars is for crackling and stoppages, too bad to continue. I never saw the movie. NOTE: The price paid was $3.99?"
0,if navel-contemplation was a competitive sport.....,"...she would have brought home the gold at the Olympics every time. Sadly it is not, so she makes lackluster records that unfortunately continue and prolong the self-important and egoistic streak that marred the best of the Maniacs' albums and tanked the worst of them. Singing and pontificating are not synonymous, nor are singing and whining.Don't even bother with this album."
1,Nice Selection,This is a nice set of different size hairsprings for someone who works on clocks. They appear to be of decent quality.
1,Outstanding!!!! Must have in your collection.,"I could listen to Chris Botti forever. The Bacharach classic ""The Look of Love"" is a must have. I think he needs to do an all Bacharach album."
0,Jim Jones facts or creative endeavor?,"The style was good, compared to films that were made in the 80s and 70s. Powers Boothe is amazing and the rest of the cast was great especially Collen Dewhurst and James Earl Jones. I wished I hadn't learned what I had about the events because I might have enjoyed the movie more."
0,coffee table book for those without a coffee table,I could hear the ohhs and ahhs from other acoustic guitariststhat would occur when looking at the pictures in this book.The author is as close to the action as possible because he represents the Martin Corp. to the artists that use them.Also Dick Boak went from dumpster diving outside Martin to holding most available positions at the company from craftsman to marketing. This volume will remain a constant reference source and entertaining to browse through.
1,Nice!,"I needed a quick connection to my Toshiba laptop when I did not want to use the built in WiFI, so I purchased the Belkin F5D5050 USB to Ethernet Adaptor, and it worked perfectly as was intended, and I would recommend it to anyone that needed such a device."
0,Poor quality,"Poor quality, but you get what you pay for, they were cheap. The orange pieces popped out when slightly pushed on (I ended up gluing them back in).I'd spend a little more money and get a good pair. I used these for myself when roller blading with my daughter and went out and bought her a better pair of knee and elbow pads that came with wrist guards. Oh, and definitely a helmet for both of us!"
1,Works well .. but use sunblock!,"I use this product off and on for a scar (pigmentation) on my hand from an oven burn. When I am consistent, it works well. But if I miss a dose, or go out in sun without sun block, (usually when driving), the pigment comes back with a vengeance! So, I guess if one is consistent and uses sunblock religiously, or avoids total sun... it can work pretty fast! It is only 2%, but I did notice a change sooner than I imagined."
0,TERRIBLE AUTHORING,Somebody has to take 20th Century Fox to task for creating hassle ware. Every time you put this DVD into your player you will be assaulted with a barrage of commercials. EVERY TIME.
1,Too Godd to resist,"I bought this tub from TRU, I fell in love with it from the moment I seen it. The shower feature looks promising and with the temperature band is even more useful. I just can't wait to get my baby girl a shower, I will repost in March when I start using the tub. I bet she will love the shower and the tingling water. I tried to research a lot on this product but couldn't coz there are just 2 reviews, I guess this tub is just introduced. I would be glad to read more reviews."
0,more of the same,"I read this book in the store. Art's book ""The Quickening"" will be popular only with those for whom the world of reality brings no message. For the less critically minded, it will generate emotional contagion. For the rest of us, it is just another reminder that what Ayn Rand said is true: Those who reject reason will never be conquered by it. Leave this book where you found it..on the shelf."
0,You get what you pay for!,"I looked at this pole online, and based on some of the reviews on AmazonI decided to go to the Coleman store and look at it in person.Well I'm glad I didn't purchase this over the internet,because I would've been unhappy with my order.I found upon further inspection of this pole in person, that it can be difficult to adjust the length of the pole and tighten it back down.Also, it doesn't have a stop for the extension, soif you extend too far it comes apart.The pole seemed weak and flimsy to me.I considered this pole after I saw that another geocacher recommended it,but I cannot recommend this pole, after trying it out in the storeand having second thoughts about it.I would recommend one of the Hamer's Poles for a little more cash."
0,While the movie was bad.....,".....these three previously written reviews made the movie worthwhile. Maybe it was the tension from a horrible movie, but these reviews made me laugh more than I have in quite awhile...."
1,An exelent occult reference.,"The table of correspondence is probably Crowley's most genius undertaking. 777's attempt to interconnect the world's diverse traditions and occult topics together under one key scale is nothing short of monumental. While some of his attributions range from questionable to embarrassingly wrong (column XXXIII is particularly disappointing to me) the preponderance of it is not only useful to wizards but to students of comparative religion as well. There is even a section on the I-Ching.As for the rest of the book, I could take it or leave it. It is mostly about Gematria, to wit, the use of ascribing numerical values to Hebrew letters. As it is well known to me that sounds can be numbers, I failed to get much out of it: hence only 4 stars. But Liber 777 is worth any unused pages."

0,Completely Useless in less than 6 months,"After less than 6(!) months the unit has failed with giving broadcast error alerts daily no matter which channel (we have 2 locally) is used, even when connected to a high gain antenna.The unit obviously has some sort of design issue."
0,Poor Packaging,"Love the picks, but the seller has shipped Medium picks twice when I ordered Thin. On my second try, they shipped Medium picks in a package marked Thin. The items are shipped in a small plastic container that easily pops open within the shipping box. So aside from losing a few during shipment, and not receiving the correct size, these are killer picks."
1,"""REAL""","This movie portrays the ""Cholo"" life better than any movie out there. It is better than ""Colors"". I grew up watching this movie and I still watch it now. I recommend it to anybody who likes realistic gang movies!!!!"
0,I like this flavor but the bars were months past expiration,"This rating is for Amazon sending me bars that were months past their expiration date. I have had this flavor (Spiced Pumpkin Pie) of Clif Bars before and I like it. However the bars I received from Amazon were dry, and the icing was yellow from age. The other flavor I ordered, Cranberry Apple Cherry, was fresh and as good as getting it from a grocery store. But I wish quality control at Amazon would make it so they do not send expired food to customers."
1,Jack Johnson is Adorable,"I enjoyed the soundtrack Curious George. These songs definitely make the movie even more watchable. The songs are very feel good, light and fun without being too wishy washy or heavy. Most of the songs are relaxing, and I have several favorites including ""Talk of the Town"" and ""Upside Down"". The children, of course, love this album. My 7 yr. old especially loves ""Broken"", ""Wrong Turn"" and ""The 3 R's"" (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle). I love that Jack includes a song about conservation and the ""3 R's"" is a fun way to learn that.If you want a nice album with a light beat that you and your children can enjoy together, then this is the one."
1,Love it!,"I love my new GPS! It is very easy to use and to understand. I have been using it to get to places I already know to see how well it works, and I have been very pleased. I like that it tells me how long I will be on a certain street and my arrival time (which adjusts as necessary in case their is traffic or you make a stop along the way). This is my first GPS and it is a great one."
0,Not for serious jobs,This book is decent if you're looking for a back-office/blue-collar type job. The tactics are very basic and the examples are childish and the format quite unprofessional. If you're looking for a real cover letter guide for the most competitive jobs look somewhere else.
0,Carpenter,"This blade shattered as I was installing it the first time. I replaced it, at about three times what it's worth, and found that it dulled quickly when cutting wood."
1,Good military history,"This is a good, solid military history. For a more general history of Ghengis Khan there are several other sources--John Man being the best of the recent ones. Weatherford's book is bad--too much of the noble savage stereotype rather than a real, honest picture of Genghis Khan. Also, some of his claims are not well supported. (Ghenghis Khan invented trading posts? I can't find a major Asian or European civilization that didn't have them before the Mongols.)"
1,North African trance music,"North African trance music from Morocco, and root music for the electrified Tuareg music making it way onto the world music scene today."
1,"Just a Fantastic, Wonderful Classic!","As a girl, I read this book a bunch of times and found it very neat. My little one just absolutely loves this book and finds it so neat how Mary Ann and Mike can dig holes so very fast. He loves to watch them build things and work hard, but was really intrigued how Mary Ann could turn into a furnace. What a great, timeless classic to be enjoyed by kids everywhere. I came back and bought it for my child so you know, it's timeless."
0,Audio problems and substandard electronics,"This mp3 player has many different features which can be useful, however, its drawbacks are rather problematic. First of all, the volume level cannot reach high enough, for those who like to listen to music at a relatively high audible level, or if the audio file is recorded at a low volume level and you need compensation. Second, the sound quality does not offer good bass sound and the stereophonic quality sound it offers is really not high quality. Third, the buttons often jam because of the fragile construction, or in other cases the circuitry jams if various different buttons are pressed too rapidly in succession because the corresponding electronic systems are poorly designed. Also, the memory size can be problematic. I would say every mp3 should offer at least 4 GB of memory."
0,What a Mess,"I used to own the previous model the DRC8312N, but the VCR was such poor quality I decided to purchase a DRC8320N. Not only is the manual impossible to understand, it took me from 1000 am to 4am to figure out how to work it. Mine had a malfunction that kept the disc tray from loading. Instead when the power was turned on the tray kept opening and closing by itself. When I pressed set-up on the remote the tray would open and close. The display on the screen would show ""Input Rear SV, CH3, Tape Eject"" I took it back to Wal-Mart for an exchange but this one did the same thing. I called RCA who couldn't help because my problem was not in their troubleshooting section. So they told me to send it back at my expense and they would either repair or replace it. I told them if the have an 8312 laying around to send that instead. Stay away from this unit at all costs. Get an 8312 if you have to."
0,Keep hummin' standards instead of recording them,"Honestly Ronstadt was ok in her 60's rock genere singing Blue Bayou, and Your No Good(which was harmless to thoise of us who don't give a hoot about rock), but that last song sums up what she is at singing jazz standards NO GOOD. However when Ronstadt decided to try the stuff Ella, Frank, and Billie once recorded, it just made her sound immature and ametuerish. I am not influenced by but a respected and a NO BS jazz critic by the nbame of Will Friedwald shares my views and so does any serious jazz listener. So please stop buying Rod Stewart albums, pop singers were meant to sing pop and jazz is not a last career saving option but an art that is meant for true talant not pure commercialism."
0,no power,"Very disappointed, even after charging, then discharging, the batteries would not hold a charge for any substantial amount of time. These were being used in walkie-talkies for use at work so needless to say my contribution to the budget cut wasn't much help at all."
1,The Wives of Henry VIII,"David Starkey gives us an excellent insight to the differences in the wives that Henry chose. He describes each Queen so well, it is as if he had met them!! I especially enjoyed the location scenes in England where so much of the intrigue took place. Very enjoyable history lesson.Scotia Ellen"
0,Boring,Most boring book in the world. Do not get this book never ever just do not get this horrible book.
0,A nice film with fresh faces,"Eric Schwab, the finest up and coming director in Hollywood, puts out an ok film on a relatively low budget. The actors are some of the newest in Hollywood (You can tell). The film didn't get many viewers in theaters because it came out the week of 9/11 but the professional reviews at that time were mostly unfavorable. I can see why."
0,Boo,"I'm normally a big bun head, but the writing on this show is super hokey... Many of the situations (and even performances) would not happen at a real school of that caliber...but hey, it's teeny bopper tv..."
0,Delta of Venus,"Ok I got it. I got it after the first 3 stories. Unless you are studying the difference between male and female fantasy, I found the book boring."
1,Awesome Book,"Edwene Gaines writes a very understandable, informative book on how to gain and live a prosperous life. The information is clear and with the touch of some personal stories, I laughed until the tears rolled from my eyes. Her story is remarkable, as are all of ours. We can all learn from each other. I would recommend this book to anyone on a spiritual journey looking to live a life fulfilled with the abundance we can all claim. Excellent."
0,Very Disapointed,I was expecting this book to be a good tool. I was wrong.This book is filled with a ton of short stories that are irrelevant to self improvement unless you are a bible thumper that spends all of your free time in the church community.I estimate that I found 10 out of the 196 pages to be filled useful content you can actually learn from.The rest of the book is useless unless you enjoy reading irrelevant stories that will likely never apply to the real world.What a waste of time and money.

1,Works like a charm,"Inexpensive, no painful yanking of hairs, does the job efficiently.Yes, it is embarassing to write a review about a nose hair trimmer. It is not, however, half as embarassing as walking around with rampaging nose hairs. To all those who silently suffer from this problem -- stop using scissors and get a trimmer!As always, blow nose before use. Batteries not included."
0,Terrible. Barely fit the mattress *before* washing!,"Terrible, cheap product. Barely fit the mattress before washing! After washing it was almost impossible. I bought a couple of these and tore one of them getting it on the mattress!"
1,Great Movie for Kids and Adults.,With cartoon movies you always wonder if it's going to be something an adult can watch too.Dreamworks did a great job with this movie. They made it enjoyable for kids and adults. The voiceovers are great and there aren't ridiculous puns thrown in all the time.The adult humor is there and wil lgo over kids heads.You can tell this is done by the same folks who have done the Shrek movies. The story is well written and it mixes fairytales of old in a compelling story.Don't be afraid to pick this up for the kids and yourself.
0,disappointing in the long run,"around the time I was studying shakespeare in my high school days I enjoyed this movie cause I was biased toward leonardo dicaprio, but it's like a kitsch parody of the classic and I would recommend reading the book instead or watching a shakespearian play."
0,Too Many Booger Jokes For Me,This CD relied on too many booger jokes for me. I thought I'd find more real humor. I would get my money back if I could.
0,It WILL stain everything it touches.,"I got this dye a week after the expected delivery. Once the dye came, I left it in for about 4 hours in my bleached copper blonde hair, expecting it to be a dark but vibrant purple. The results: Stained hands, back, legs, shower, sink, counter, and BLACK hair with a blue-ish purple-ish tint. I could have just bought ""blue black"" hair dye by garnier, that I used in 2010, and I would have gotten the same results WITHOUT bleaching. I wasn't exactly prepared for it to be this messy, as the only other ""unnatural"" semi-permanent hair dye I've used is Manic Panic's Cotton Candy Pink, which didn't stain anything at all, and was very vibrant and eventually faded to a pretty pastel pink. I'm sure this color works a lot better on platinum bleached hair, but it's incredibly messy/staining and disappointing nonetheless. I'm going to try bleaching my hair again, and try Special Effects pimpin' purple ^_^ I definitely recommend avoiding this dye."
1,Very well made...,"We have a 5 year old black lab who can destroy any and every toy we've bought her. She's been playing with her Kong Frisbee for over a month and it's still in great shape. We were a little concerned that it wouldn't throw like a regular frisbee and it does take a couple tries to figure it out, but then it flies just the same. I highly recommend!"
0,Boring.,"This book lacked plot and had no conflicts whatsoever. It may look awe-inspiring but it really isn't. I couldn't even finish it towards the end, it was THAT bad."
0,I Agree - please don't buy this phone,"I also bought the phone based on looks and name. There is a confusing delay between when a number is pressed and the sound made. Numbers must be re-entered most all the time and the static is so bad I can't use it, even up close. I have never written one of these before, but have never been so displeased with a cordless either."
0,Completely without Value,"This router drops my connection every few minutes. I've spent hours on the phone with Belkin and replaced the whole thing. A quick internet search finds dozens of people reporting the same problem, with no solution offered.It's just no good."
0,"AWESOME MOVIE, HORRIBLE GAME!","I am sorry for all the Dead Mans Chest fans that wasted money on this game. It has gameboy color graphics and if you like violence games, this is not one to get.I am only ten and it is not violent enough! The minigames are boring! And thats not all! During the entire gameplay you only play as Jack, Elizabeth, and Will. There are parts of the game that were not even in the movie! Make sure you see the movie before playing the game because the game would be a horrible first impression. I beg of you, no matter what the media says, do not fall into the same trap as me!Sincerely,Parker 100."
0,Skips around way too much.,"This thing skips around way too much to be entertaining. I suppose that the ADHD generation would enjoy it, but for those sound of mind, it skips around way too much. I watched the entire Battlestar Galactica(BG) series and this wasn't really a compliment to the series at all. I felt like it was mostly clips pieced together from the series along with some very short skits that they threw in to fill the story gaps. It really isn't worth $14 because it doesn't really tell any more than you would have already known at the end of the BG series. And for those who have never watched BG, ""The Plan"" will make absolutely no sense."
1,Needs Work,"Norris covers the technical aspects of flying very well, but the plot on this book was extremely thin. He manages to keep it moving, however. He does need a better story concept on his next book to better implement his writing skills."
1,Nice to see Johnny Depp play a normal person!,"I am not a big Angelina Jolie fan, but I do enjoy Johnny Depp. Part of what makes Depp a great actor is his ability to play such a wide range of characters. This particular time, he plays someone normal - and I liked it! He plays a very convincing unassuming college math teacher which makes for great dynamics with Jolie's seductress image. I will want to see it again...maybe even purchase the movie."
1,Good Customer Service,"I was not as pleased with this product as I had hoped to be. When I contacted the seller, they were very apologetic, were very helpful about providing good customer service and I will buy from them again based on their speedy, friendly response."
1,Better than going to the GYM anyday,This is an excellent video it works every part of your body and is very motivating for those of us who would like to workout in private. I reccommend this video for shy people like me who would like to workout in private.
1,The excavation of a Neutral cemetery,"This is the archeological report published by the Royal Ontario Museum of the excavation of Neutral cemetery dating from c. 1640-1650 that was conducted at Grimsby, Ontario, Canada from October 1976 to April 1977. In total, 55 graves were discovered, from which the remains of 367 individuals were removed. The book deals with each grave individually, although in most cases the description consists of little than a short paragraph. Included are a number of figures and plates. All in all, the report gives one interesting insight into the lives and customs of the Neutral Indians, and a better understanding of pre-European occupancy of southwestern Ontario."
1,This book glows with an inner light.,"After reading the first book about Andrej, the second one offers an even more astonishing emotional journey in an inhuman world, where, amazingly the echoes of the holocaust wail in a mystical fog of pain,a world where a sadistic man is elevated to near sainthood, and it is awe inspiring, that it can be so, and there's a profound lesson in this,no wonder Matthews is often likened to Dostojevski,for that's very approppriate, to say that she brings the emotional, and in a certain way, religious experience into the world of science fiction. By writing a mercilessly hard story,the author makes the light of Andrej's humanity enormously comforting.May all of us who ever have to face evil in any form, outside and within ourselves, have the strenght and courage the doctor has."
1,Good Book,"I love the book by George C. Kenny who in my opinion apart from Claire Chennault was one of the greatest air generals of World War II.The only reason why I gave it four stars was because there were a few things that General Kenny did not talk about a few things about Bong. I read the book Jungle Ace about Gerald Johnson and discover that Bong had lost three wingmen in three months and Bong swore that he would never fly with a wingman again. In the book, 49th Fighter Group by William Hess, I found out that Bong's aircraft was hit a few times in a number of engagements by the Japanese."
1,Fresh portrayal of rural reality,"Dan Domench's characters speak in voices that reflect the inherent conflicts of modern life. The pain, the confusion and the jarring issues of identity speak through his words. The actors' readings remain fresh, no matter how often repeated."
1,fun,Both my 7 and 4 year old daughters have enjoyed this toy. They enjoy building two different paths and then racing the marbles to see which one is faster. Great toy.
1,Just what I need,Fits the Canon SD870 perfectly. The camera is not moving around in the the case but there's still room so it doesn't get hurt either.You can either flip off the top and have the entire camera in the case or leave the top cover behind and use it as a pocket. Either way is very useful.I wouldn't say the make is very decent if you take a deep look at it but it's already of the top-design at this price level.
1,What I have been Looking For - A Superb Bible,"I have been wanting to read the entire Bible (am a Methodist) and wanted a version that reflected all the latest findings without any specific preaching--In other words I wanted to read and make up my own mind. This is it. Plus the notes are excellent and easy to follow along the text (they are not at bottom but interspersed among the relevant text--a big plus) and the maps are great--everything in one volume. I think it is the best and helps one to really study and learn. Do what I did--compare it with others and see which one helps you really understand the context, culture, and what was being said."
1,Bottomless resource,This book helped me keep my drills fresh all season. There were things I had no idea how to teach before this book. It also gave me confidence to adapt my own drills off these professional ones. Lots of advanced stuff in here for high school and above.

0,Error E-45 message- Another Victim,I experience the infamous E-45 error today. Kind of ironic that other customers have reported this within a 2 month period. HUMMM.... It is probably cheaper to buy a new camera than to send it out for repair.
1,REPAIRED MY SPLITTING NAILS!,I used to have splitting nails. peeling at top so i wore fake nails- but i heard about this polish- now this polish has repaired that. I have long natural nails now! I put it on daily til they grew & then after they were stronger I just use once a week now. I do paint my nails once a week..
1,Just Like at the Hospital,"These little brushes work wonders at keeping my baby from having cradle cap. The one I brought home from the hospital was tearing after a couple of months, so I ordered these. I don't need 30, but they'll make great baby shower gifts."
1,Great VB/DB book,"I was searching for a DB book with VB .NET example code and there are lots of them. A friend recommended this one and I'm glad she did. There's so much information in this book; it's unbelievable. I skipped chapter 1, but chapter 2 was an excellent refresher, as the author states, and I can certainly use this chapter for later reference. I'm an experienced DB developer and I DO know about normal forms, but like many people I forget ""things"" now and then, so this chapter is a very quick reference. Part II and III are excellent introductions to the two ADO.NET layers and after reading through them, I really understand the concepts of ADO.NET and especially the way it works with disconnected data access. These two parts with apendixes C and D are excellent as reference guides and I can recommend the book just for these chapters/appendixes. Wait, there's more: Stored Procedures, Views, Triggers, exception handling and much more. Truly a book for any serious VB/DB developer."
1,Great pair of jeans.,This is the third time I've ordered this brand and style of jeans after buying my first pair. They all have fit very well; they are very comfortable; they wash and wear well. I've never worn a pair out although I've worn them a lot. I've just needed different sizes. It's the only style of jeans I wear.
1,Excellent group teaching tool,"This book is an excellent teaching tool for group piano. I found the exercises thorough, and the theory concepts complete. I would recommend it for anyone who wants a comprehensive overview of the piano."

1,Read this book BEFORE you join the gym!,"Sam Fussell, an atypical ""musclehead"" with an Oxford education, provides an eye-opening look at one man's quest of getting ""big."" His goal was, at first noble; to become stronger, healthier. Over time, however, his goal became an unhealthy obsession, that overtook his life at the expense of all else. Fussell is bright and articulate, telling his story in a manner that lets the reader experience the highs and lows of one man's emotional journey into the world of bodybuilding. NOTE: His addiction could have been alcohol, cocaine, or sex--it happened to be iron."
0,didn't really help,"This book is very short and doesn't really have any good suggestions or solutions. I have flat feet and a lot of pain in my feet and lower legs (up to knees) because of it. This book tries to solve that problem with visualization techniques to get you to walk correctly and keep your ankle, calf bones and knees lined up correctly. But it didn't have any concrete steps one could take to minimize foot and knee pain. No exercises or recommendations on shoe inserts, etc. I wanted and expected more from it."
1,"Very nice vacuum, only problem: tubes break fast.","I got this vacuum for someone, and they are very happy. I have one too, that's couple years old now. It's lightweight and comfortable, but gentle - the tube broke off from both the handle and the vacuum joint, I had to tape it with duct tape."
0,Gunbird is a RENTER ONLY PEOPLE,"Look I love my old school sprite shooters but this game gets old really really quick. I promise you will thank me about this. It IS however a good rental game. I bought it, I couldnt help myself, before playing this. I hade all of 10 minutes of fun then the games was over! It is soooo short that the only life we get outta of the game now is multiplayer and even that is old. Look if I were you I would wait for a game called GigaWing 2 which is scheduled for release this year. It is 10x better than the original and features high resolution sprites instead of the ... CS2 we get here or on GigaWing 1."
0,Total Junk,"I bought two - one for me, and one for my wife. The first one just stopped working after a couple days. I returned it. The second one started out giving unbelievable static whenever you jiggled the cord - then the left channel died. I'm returning it, too. Seriously, don't waste your money!!"

1,"Not bad, just misunderstood!","I was walking with two friends, one of whom really enjoyed this film (as I did) and one of whom disliked it intensely. The friend who disliked the film said to the two of us, ""I'm sorry, but you can't build a whole movie on Bruce Willis and Danny Aiello wisecracking with each other."" We looked at him in disbelief and said, in unison, ""YES you can!!!""That pretty well sums up the Hudson Hawk experience. If you go into it expecting a typical Bruce Willis film, you'll be disappointed. It's a fast-paced film full of bizarre humor and great lines and scenes. The closest comparison I can draw would be if you were to mix up the ""Taming of the Shrew"" episode of Moonlighting and a 60s action film. The dialog is quick-paced, and there's *nothing* in the film which isn't a joke. If you're looking for a serious or sane film, look elsewhere. But one way or the other, if you've ever wanted to really laugh at Bruce Willis, this is the film to do it in. ;)"
0,quality is awful and too much filler of no consequence,Much of the bits used as filler here are best forgotten. The efforts would've been better spent on good transfers of the major films. Save your money until someone does it right.
1,"Sharp, witty and on the dot.","I studied image consulting with Robert Pante last year and he helped me break though many personal barriers i had put up towards more success. He is not interested in trying to puff up your ego. He is commited to helping you gain results in your life. Changing my image has helped me personally gain tremendous confidence and it shows in how my colleagues, clients and friends now see me. He comes highly recommended!"
0,Soooooooooo Bad,"I bought this cause I wanted a good track of Ghost Rider for my customs.And I thought.. for 10 bucks, maybe another good track.Well now..

1,thank god for church leaders who are entrepreneurs,"These folks are out on the edge, and I am glad for it. We do have to begin speaking the language of our church members who are in the post-literate generation.

1,Our family loves these DVDs,"I forgot how much I loved Little House on the Prairie as a child. These shows are great, and I've created a new fan in my daughter.It is really great to be able to read the insert with the DVDs that describe each show, so you can pick which show you want, or you can just watch them one after the other."
0,Small but very unreliable,Just like what the other people have posted. This product is very unrealiable. Sometimes it works sometimes it doesn't. Then it got to the point where you're unable to turn in off(I have to remove the batteries to power it off). And then one day it just stop playing. And the warranty just expired last month.There are other products out there; don't waste your money on this. I'm currently back to my old Compaq Ipaq; Still deciding whether I should get iRiver or Digitalway.
0,loose and lost battery cover,"The first time we emptied the can and replaced the lid, the plastic battery compartment cover and the batteries dropped into the can. Despite our care to always secure it - including holding it in place with duct tape - the cover was eventually accidently thrown out with the trash, taking the batteries along with it. After several unsuccessful attempts to replace the cover we just use the can with the lid either permanently up or down. Not very sanitary or convenient."
0,Cheap junk,"Yes, it sticks well, but the handle is junk. It came loose after only a few throws. SOG's lifetime warranty does not include its Fusion line, which is warranted only for a year, and only IF you can produce the receipt. Who saves the receipts for a $25.00 tool?"
0,Not the best,"This is probably the worst phone I have ever owned. The sound quality is tin-can at best, the rings are all annoying, the buttons are teeny and hard to use."
1,Great choice for history lovers!,"I purchased this book for my dad who had an interest in learning more about Porter Rockwell. He really enjoyed the book! He said it was very interesting to read and very informative. The only downside was the length. This book is HUGE. It's a whole lot of reading... But if you like history and like to read, highly recommended!!!"

0,Palm Z22 Lover,"I purchased this and within a couple of weeks purchased the Palm Z22 Every Day Case. I feel this case just didn't fit the Palm Z22 very well. It has slots for memory cards and the Palm Z22 doesn't hold memory cards. Overall, this case wasn't what I needed. I feel it is probably more suited for the larger Palm handhelds."
0,Size problems and falls apart,"Sizing was an issue. Couldn't find any sizing information on the order page. Sizes run small, so I ended up with one that was too small. Got a replacement that was the correct size. The waist-band is coming off with less than a week of use. I've repaired it myself, since I don't want to be without the truss waiting for yet another replacement (let alone the hassle of trying to get hold of someone and explaining, etc.). The truss does its job well, it's just falling apart."
0,This book is insulting,"The fundamental flaw in this book can be seen in the title. There is no Jewish new testament. The Jewish bible is the Tanakh. ""Testament"" itself is a Christian term. If you believe that Jesus or Yeshu or whoever is the messiah you might be many things but you would not be Jewish. Unfortunately, you cannot have your matzot and eat it too."
0,Tasted Terrible!,"I have read the other reviews about this and I do not understand how people could think this tasted good. I thought it was horrible and I couldn't even finish it. It left a terrible almost metallic aftertaste that made me want to rinse my mouth out. Maybe I received a bad package. I also had a friend try and he thought it was terrible, as well."

0,Skip it,"I couldn't finish this book. I've read other Star Wars novels that I wasn't particularly fond of, but this one I found to be particularly egregious. It was a whole lot of boring military strategy and bad characterizations. When Anakin started thinking that his shiny new mechanical arm was so nice that perhaps he should have his other arm replaced I stopped reading. I understand its my own personal taste, but I would prefer my Star Wars fiction to not read like a dramatization of historical battles. If I wanted that, I'd re-read Dune."
1,AMAZING,"My brothers had listened to Audio Adrenaline for as long as I can remember, but I didn't listen to them until this past year when I got Don't Censor Me. I listened to it and couldn't beleive it. Everything was perfect, the lyrics(Rest Easy),the music(Scum Sweetheart), everything. This is one of the best albums of all time. If you like music, I recommend it. It'll blow you away!"

These clamps are easy to use with the sliding clamp head and can apply a strong pressure to the piece you're gluing. You can put a wood shim under the jaws to avoid marring the wood surface. The bar will rust if not oiled or waxed but a little steel wool will clean it up. The 36"" will handle most clamping needs and the price is low enough to allow buying enough for uniform clamping."
1,An excellent tool for Christian life,"I feel Bible DVDs are an excellent idea, this NIV is the second Bible DVD I have and as I try to go through the Bible 2X in a year I use mine almost everyday, the day seems incomplete if I have not read the Bible (or now Bible DVD). I listen for about 35 minutes on average, usually about enough for 6 - 10 chapters a day. The only difficulty I find is that sometimes the DVD freezes for a few seconds, then it flips on to the next chapter. Overall I think this is an excellent idea, all Christians should seek to go through the Bible at least once a year."
1,The Best,"Once I picked this book up and started reading I couldnt put it down. I was so upset when I realized it was 1 am and needed to get some sleep, but I finished the book promptly the next afternoon! I cried at the ending, not because of the ending, but because I was so sad the book was over! I want to start it all over again and lose myself in the beautiful writing..."
0,"Started off well, then downhill","Like so many other reviewers, I wanted to like this book. And I did enjoy it for the first third or so, but then I just wanted to tell the main character to get over it already. She whines about her break-up to just about everyone she meets, including movie stars, doctors, etc.. My sympathy ran out early, and I kept waiting for her to show some interest in any other character's life or problems, which never happened."
0,Dull,"The product arrived in a very timely fashion but, so far all the blades are dull. Not sure if this is Gillette's fault, bad batch or a reselling of B grade merchandise under the guise of A grade merchandise."
1,Off the hook!!!,"This is my favorite song in the entire world! It sounds especially nice to the ""Candy children"" ha ha Perfect song for a rave or club in SF. I have it on my voicemail for my celphone & have had many compliments on the song."
1,New/Old Sound of Bluegrass,"I'm a huge fan of Bluegrass music. I used to be also a huge buyer of CDs, but they got expensive and I started suscribing to XM, so I haven't bought any for a long time. This CD MADE me go out and buy it! The problem with listening to Bluegrass is that a lot of the songs start to sound the same. That's not saying anything bad about Bluegrass, any kind of music shares that same critique, look at radio rock or radio country.Both of these guys are great, but Mark Johnson takes the banjo to a whole new level. Girl from the North Country gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. I've never heard a banjo like that and I've been playing banjo myself for 26 years. His style is old time clawhammer, but with a drive and difference that has to be heard. I hope that this album is getting the attention it deserves and I hope this group stays on its awsome road to innovation."
0,1937 recording quality,be warned this CD was made from records recorded in 1937 and the quality is far below a modern CD (or even 1950's LPs). It may be artistically significant (I can't judge) but you probably don't want it for your only version of this music.
1,Works Great,"I bought this portable hard drive over a year ago and have been happy ever since. I use it to store ISO images of software titles, music, documents and pretty much anything else I need. I have not tried to use it as a dedicated backup drive but I imagine it would work fine in that situation. Overall, the drive is sleek and fits nicely in my backpack. Moving files to the drive isn't lightening fast but it isn't snail slow either. It is also relatively quiet compared to other external devices I have used in the past. I would definitely buy this again though I would probably want something slightly larger in capacity so I can carry more ""stuff"" around with me."
0,More of the same nothing new,"More of the same sex talk. Not much new data. The pictures where cool, but not what I expected in general."
1,Exelent Book,Not only a very complet book about cellular comunications but also an easy one to understand
0,Don't bother,This is the worst film I have seen for at least 3 years I was so bored at the end of this I thought I had died and gone to hell. my advice is if you want a bonfire buy this film otherwise avoid it
0,Coheed and Cambira? More like Blowheed and Crapia!,"Seriously, Coheed fails as an emo band. (For those of you who deny they're emo, Wikipedia says they're emo, and Wikipedia is ALWAYS right!) They also fail as a concept album band. The lead singer sounds like he has been roundhoused in the nads too many times, and the story is stupid! It's a Star Wars ripoff. The band members really need to lose their virginity.For a good concept album, check out ""Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water."""
0,NOT for new technology users!,"unless you have a VHS and other old equipment/ tv, etc, this will not work for you! welcome to the 21st century... we have a 2009 model flat screen LCD, a PS3, a DVD player, and a nice surround sound, and this model will absolutely not work. i don't remember the technical reasons my husband said, but something about there only being an output on our equipment and this thing requiring an input (we even went to radio shack and best buy to look for a converter, and no one carries them... probably because it doesn't make sense to. the converter would mean taking a higher quality sound from your equipment and inputing it into a lower quality equipment [this headphone set]). anyway. useless."
0,Avoid this phone!,"I bought this base unit and three of the individual phones for use in my home. They just don't hold a charge. I can't tell you the frustration you'll feel when the phone rings, and you pick it up directly from the charging base, only to have the call disconnect due to lack of power. It doesn't matter how long its in the charger. Although it's nice to look at, unless the fix the battery, avoid this one."
1,The Best Shooter Out There,"This game is the best shooter I've ever played. It extremely funny and doesn't have the 'dark' atmosphere or story that most shooters have (Half-Life, RtCW, Deus Ex, all these games have a dark presence), but this game is very......... uhhhhhhhh not dark. Yah."
0,No Housing Bubble? HA!,"The real estate market does nothing but go straight up, up, up! No price is ever too high! I've got a bridge to sell you with an adjustable negative amortization loan and rising interest rates! Ha, Ha, Ha!There, now you've read the book. Don't you feel smarter, having saved tons of time reading this summary, rather than reading a book by this shill for the industry?"
1,Gibson Brothers-Excellent Bluegrass Harmony,"I have loved Bluegrass music since I was a child and this album is the best. It was given to me by my uncle, who unfortunatley has now passed on,but his love of music lives on every time I play it. I listen to it in the car, walking, relaxing, ALL the time.The harmony of the two brothers is so beautiful that I can't help but sing along.This particular selection of songs touches the heart and soul.Sometimes bluegrass can be heavy on some instuments but the balance of these songs is perfect.A beautiful blend of harmony and lyrics.I can't choose a favorite. They're all excellent. I hope they keep up the good work and produce another one soon. Can't wait!!"
0,missing pieces,"Upon reading the introduction, I discovered there was an audio CD to accompany the book that was not provided (standard). I wrote to the author and was informed that, for [money](+... shipping), I could buy the audio CD's directly from him.As far as a textbook quality goes, I cannot rate it accurately because I have not used it fully. Upon first and subsequent impressions, it is much more complex than texts in the romance languages, which probably should be expected. It seems to offer very little support for slow learners like me.I rate the book with two stars because I desire to give it the benefit of the doubt (due to all of it's other wonderful reviews)."
0,DO NOT purchase this book until you read this!,"Please be forewarned that this is NOT one of Ms. Lowell's best efforts! Do NOT purchase it unless you must have a copy for your collection. In that case, I would suggest a good used copy. It is a reprint of an earlier Harlequin edition. Need I say more? Yes, I believe I will. There is very little plot and not enough depth to the characters to explain why they are as they are, especially Reever's character."
1,What a way to go,I bought the cd for the title song. I was very suprized to find that for the most part the whole cd is pretty good. The title song is still a riot to listen to though.
1,New Product Great with Price.,I have got this product from Office Depot. It has all new microsoft Zune Home A/C Pack. Good for everything.
0,Don't be fooled!!,"He makes a good point that health care would be wonderful IF it was free and readily available, but that is not a good idea for the US and the way it SHOULD be. It SHOULD be that the government stays out of the peoples lives here in the US. Government health care, i.e. Hilary-Care, is going to be MESS. It will cost much to setup, then after setup they will alter the way of it to save money, then it will be a very shody and risky system. Government control of most anything, in some ways even ""security"", is mostly always a bad thing for the citizens. This is a short and vague discription of why its bad but but beleive me this DVD has a sugar-coated, poisony message."
1,A lovely read,"I picked up Breakfast with Scot off the ""new releases"" shelf of my local book store merely because I wanted a break from the well known books I had been told I HAD to read by friends or family. Plus, I liked the way the cover looked. Suprisingly I loved the book and whizzed through it in a few days. While I was reading it it was all I could think about. Now, a few months later, I can't really remember much about the book accept that I loved it, unlike most books I read that fast that I can still discuss in detail years later. So, if you're looking for a great but easy read this book is perfect for you. If you're looking for a book that will change your life, this is not it."
0,I wanted to like this,"I recently purchased The Polar Express... again. The plot is cloying, the central theme revolving around cardboard characters. The backgrounds are exquisite. The faces of the characters are likely frightening to younger children and are extremely off-putting, in particular, the character of the main female lead. Plot points are made with a sledge hammer... repeatedly, but as my wife said, for little kids, that might be appropriate. But some of the scenes would probably frighten little kids.I wanted to like this. I like Tom Hanks, I like Christmas and I like Christmas movies. This one though seems geared to getting Christmas presents, characters are introduced and leave. The subplot labored, all in all, unless you are a fan of commercial Christmas, I would suggest giving this a wide berth."
1,Irwin Bolt Remover,"These things are the greatest! I tried everything in my tool box to remove a boogered bolt head. The Irwin bolt extractor had it out in seconds. I just fit the proper size extractor socket over the rounded bolt head, gave it a yank and the bolt was loose -- didn't even slip at all. They are made from quality materials, are heavy-duty and they work. Don't even think twice about getting yourself a set. Just order 'em."
1,Simply Great!,"This is one of the best martial arts films to come out in the last five years. Jet Li is incredible! And the fight scenes are well choreographed and filmed. Buy it, trust me, this is no ""Crouching Boredom, Hidden Movie"".."
0,Doesn't hold the ethernet cable securely.,"I bought this to use with my TiVO. It works fine when it's connected, but it doesn't hold the ethernet cable securely enough. The slightest movement will break the connection with the unit. When my frustration level exceeds my annoyance level at having wasted my money on this thing, I'll buy something more sturdier."
1,"Not perfect, but satisfying","If you're looking for action-packed or lots of blood, this isn't the film for you. There are a few mostly useless ""scream-inducing cat jumping out at the protagonist"" type moments.I watched on Instant Video, so none of the awkward editing mentioned by another reviewer. The Caller is a slow-paced thriller, very reminiscent of some of Hitchcock's works. It does require that you think to enjoy the story."
0,WHAT?!?!?!?,"Okay, my wife and I just watched this yesterday and I have to say I'm shocked to see all the good reviews. I was almost in tears I was so bored. It was like a really bad 'made-for-TV' movie! I swear if it weren't for the chemistry between Bette Midler and Dennis Farina it would have been a complete waste of time...At least they were funny and natural and believable. Their daughter, played by Paula Marshall was terrible. The whole story was ruined by horrid acting (the two leads aside) and crappy dialog. When we saw the movie at the library we were excited for the plot (about a divorced couple played by Midler and Farina who hate each other rekindling their passion for each other and starting up an affair during their daughters wedding) seemed like it would be funny and enjoyable. Boy were we wrong. This has got to be one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't waste your time."
1,Great information but map error,"I am getting ready to start tent camping again after a long time away from it, and this book has wonderful information about campgrounds near me. The only problem I've found so far is that the map of the Grout Pond recreation area in VT has mistakes. 2 sites he describes in the book aren't on the map at all, and one site is on the opposite site of the hiking trail from where he says it is. I guess I'll have to go myself to see which is the correct location."
1,Uplifting Book!,"David Saltzman's book, ""The Jester Has Lost His Jingle,"" is an excellent book that teaches children and adults the importance of a positive attitude and laughter.The main character is a Jester that discovers that everyone has lost their sense of humor and he goes on a journey to find out why there is no laughter.My favorite part of the book is when Saltzman writes, ""Then it isn't me at all! It's the world that must be sick. We must find that sense of humor, and bring it back here quick!""On his journey he discovers that people are dealing with ""Real"" issues (ie...depression, poverty, sickness, etc...) and he takes it upon himself to help people find their ""Jingle.""The message of this book is very positive and it helps the reader to value laughter and a positive attitude.The illustrations are beautifully done and your child is sure to love this colorful and valuable book.I highly recommend ""The Jester Has Lost His Jingle."""
1,Made of Duct Tape?,"I picked this up in an Airport, having been familiar with and a fan of Rucka's comic book work (Whiteout). I read it straight through on the plane and could not put it down! It grabbed me and didn't let go. The characters were rich and detailed, the plot kept me guessing, and the overall aesthetic of the book made me a firm fan of Greg Rucka."
1,Love this machine!!,"My husband purchased this machine a couple of weeks ago. I balked at the price, but when we made the pasta it was so well worth it. It's a heavy duty machine and you can actually hear the motor remaining consistent and not struggling at all. We made delicious whole wheat pasta in less than 45 minutes. We dried it, vacuum sealed it and froze it. I HIGHLY recommend this product!!!"
1,Good deal for the money,I have been using this vacuum for about 3 weeks.I have 2 dogs that shed a lot. With the adjustable heights it does a nice job on both carpets and hardwood floors. The hose suction has more than enough power to clean tight areas. Light weight and easy to push. Have to dump the canister frequently and clean filters which is pretty easy. The $50 I paid for this refurbished vacuum is totally worth it.
0,I still haven't received this!!,I still haven't received this product. Hopefully it will arrive any day but I have waited one month.
1,STRAIGHT FIRE !!!,THIS CD FROM BEGINNING TO END IS OFF THA CHAIN! NO NEED TO FAST FORWARD! EVERY SONG DESERVES A VIDEO! CHAMILLIONAIRE HAS MAJOR SKILLS AND FLOW! GET THIS CD! YOU BETTER GET TWO BECAUSE MY GIRLFRIEND WOULDNT GIVE MY COPY BACK SO I HAD TO BUY ANOTHER ONE!
1,Brilliant!,"When I first tried this stuff, I really didn't expect what happened. You immediately feel calm, and slightly happy, but, although it tastes very much like alcohol, not at all drunk. You experience almost drowsiness, and it's great,Much recommended, and it really works."
0,It's a sham!,"The woman who ""edited"" the real Jay's journal, Beatrice Sparks, only used 12 of the actual entries from ""Jay"" -and none of those entries or any other entries in his journal mentioned the occult in any way. Sparks is a scammer and ruined that family's life. Beyond that, what else is inexcusable is what a terrible writer she is and how she used the same terrible prose in her other scam book, ""Go Ask Alice.""No one should give her anymore money. Shame on you, Beatrice Sparks!"
0,Unscary dragons and just all around boring,"Most every book about dragons is at least a little frightening. This one doesn't fit into that catergory. The dragons were pretty easily defeated, and weren't all that scary to begin with."
1,Really tasty,"I don't have to eat gluten free, but I'm testing things for a friend's visit in a month. I wanted to try cornbread since it's an item I love. This cornbread is great. I prefer a more cake-like cornbread that isn't gritty and this one works for me very well.I didn't have the suggested ""grey 9x9 pan"" mentioned on the baking instructions and since I wasn't sure how important the pan was, I skipped my glass one and used two grey loaf pans. I just divided the batter and baked for about 30 minutes. It turned out nice and fluffy, moist and delicious. I like it with a smear of lowfat margarine, a drizzle of honey and a dash of cinnamon. It's like dessert. I've eaten it for breakfast and for snacking.It's a recipe that anybody can enjoy, even if one isn't on a restricted diet. Thanks, Bob's Red Mill."
0,Bass control at bottom of floor,"Bass control is at bottom of floor, next to the dirt and grime of the corner. You have to bend down to the most corner far away to play with a black knob. Nice sound but controls designed in 1971. I guess that is what you get with Boze, I mean he is 95 years old now please Dr. Boze, why don't you hire an engineer a third your age and put a wireless control that lets you adjust treble, bass, etc., etc., etc., from anywhere?No input from the ipod, just USB.Does it sound nice? I guess.Where is the treble control??? I can't find it.Returning."
0,Poor performance = disappointed daughter.,"I bought this sewing machine for my daughter's 6th birthday. Shortly after taking it out of the box we noticed that the item shipped didn't match the pictured item in concerning ways. Namely, the item received didn't include a safety guard around the needle. It wasn't merely missing from the box - this specific item was not designed to even incorporate one. Also, the foot doesn't stay up. All the stitches pull out after sewing ANYTHING despite our best efforts. Overall a highly disappointing product. I'd suggest spending additional money to get a real sewing machine and sign the user up for lessons at a local sewing retailer. Happy sewing!"
0,Pictures?,"I ordered this book online, and just received it. A quick scan through and my first impression was...pictures? Where are they? It's a cookbook about cupcakes. I'm probably going to decide which ones I want to make based on how good they look. That may sound simplistic, but when's the last time a recipe grabbed you without a picture to go from? Especially when you *paid* for the book.I already had ""Hey There, Cupcake! 35 Yummy Fun Cupcake Recipes for All Occasions"" but there was no recipe in there to make the kind of frosting that piles up sky-high, which is why I bought this book (I have recently developed a love for cupcakes). I don't see any kind of frosting recipe like that in here. Literally, I don't *see* a recipe for that frosting. I doubt I'll use this book at all."
1,Human Body DVD,I'm studying this in college so it's a nice tool to review often. The blu-ray is icying on the cake.
1,Babysitters,"Having trouble getting your kids to stay with a babysitter? This book is for you. I got this book as a gift when I was a kid and 20 years later, I still own it. It's just one of those books I can't part with.The book is about a young girl and her parents. The parents are planning a night out and are going to leave the girl with Bob, the babysitter. The book leads up to the girl's fears of being with a sitter, however in the end, she ends up having a great time with Bob.I wish more parents knew about this book. It's creative, imaginative and a favorite book you're kids will have for many, many, years."
0,Buyer Beware!,"At no point in the books sample pages nor in it's summary does it warn the reader/buyer about the pornagraphic content of the sample photos.I have no objection to artists compiling books around their interests, but PLEASE let the buyer know that the content of the photos may be objectionable.Or at the very least, include them in your samples. I found this book to be quite offensive rather than instructional, and I returned it back to Amazon.Very dissapointed."
1,Any Metal Head will love this Album!!!,"When I first heard this band on the radio, I holy hell this is a bad ass band!! I immediatly changed course from going to my friends house to going to best buy and buying all of the albums they had there which was only 2...but it was worth it, they were awesome. Mind Bending Guitar........SO FAST!! great singing, everything is just the best. Favorite Band by far!!! Nothing comes close. If i could have given it extra stars i would have!!oh yah and the guy that said it was just techno with Double Bass what a homo not even close he definetly doesnt know music!! JOIN THE HATE CREW GUYS!!! I look forward to their fame in the US!! Maybe we'll see them at ozzfest!!"
1,Nintendo Wii Tomagotchi,My 8 year old daughter found this game for $3.50. My first thought was....it must be pretty crappy if it costs that little. But she really seems to be enjoying it. There are not too many Wii games that are interesting enough to hold her interest without being too difficult for her to play. She also bought Tomagotchi 2 (Corner store?) for the DS and LOVES that game.
1,Worth Reading,"New frontiers and new incidents brought to the map. Similar in essence to already available books on the subject, however the presentation is responsible and more comprehensive. Solid evidence? Yes. Something totally new? NO. Worth reading? Absolutely!"
1,Credit After Bankruptcy,"This book probably needs to be taken with a grain of salt. But the key points of the book of to ""let go"" and the ""go to"" information is RIGHT ON. Those the are not keen to the ""church chapter"", I understand. But, there are principles of life that work.First, forgive yourself. Bankrupcty is not the end of the world. Second, GIVE. Those that think that they are on rock bottom when filing bankrupcty should know that, now, the only way is up. Count your blessings, GIVE and you shall receive, and remember to pay yourself FIRST.In financial terms, if you remember to FORGIVE yourself, look up and forward (not backward) and pay yourself FIRST... then, this book will definitely benefit you. You will gain leverage NOW, verses allowing that 10 years of waiting for the credit bureaus to give your your freedom.What can I say, it is a real life experence and documentation of the process of recovering."
1,Carroll O'Connor's Memoir of All My Families,"As a very big ""All in the Family"" fan, I was looking very forward to reading this book. It is really good because it goes deep into Carroll and you find out who he is and what is about. As previous readers have stated the book can be slow and rambling, but you have to be prepared for things like that in memoirs. Overall, I thought it was a very good book that should be read by Carroll O'Connor and All in the Family fans."
0,A total bore...,"I've listened to Larry Carlton since the early days and I've seen him many times. Thus it was hugely dissapointing to hear this CD; I've know that most everything he's come out with since ""Friends"" has been basically... bland, elevator music (of course in my humble opinion). I figured however a live album with Robben Ford would be a different situation--> 100% wrong. This was perhaps the most boring live album I've listened to in many many years. Unlike the other reviewer, I even though the version of Rio Samba was a total dude; it could have been great but it wasn't.If you like Larry's more recent work, I'm sure you'll like this album. But if you're into the older Larry Carlton work and want to listen to some of his live work--> get the two older albums (both recorded live in Japan)."
1,Fantastic,These alcohol pads are conveniently packaged in single use squares. They work perfectly for what I ordered them for - use before a chemical peel. Thanks! =)
1,Homeschooling Mama of Two,"I totally disagree with the person who previously reviewed this product and commented about the manufacturers age recommendations. My child is 2 and respects her things - she would never carry her Leap Pad by the pen. This is a wonderful toy with wonderful learning activities. I am a homeschooling Mama who tests many educational items. My 2 year old has the My First Leap Pad and my 4 year old has the regular Leap Pad, and both are wonderful toys! I think the person who made that comment should teach their child to appreciate and respect their things!"
1,Awesome,"Wish there were more books like this. The cook book section requires a lot of deciphering though. I've got a chemistry degree which helps, but I still spent a lot of time researching the chemicals and apparatus."
1,Sheets are good quality and price!,"These are nice sheets for my trend labs Moses basket. They fit 29"" by 11"". The only downside is the coloring. They are barely pink at all, it looks more like someone threw in something pink with the whites when washing :) The quality is good and they hold up in the washing machine well. They also fit nicely on the pad without being to tight or to loose."
1,Pretty good overall,"It is pleasantly large and is of fairly high quality, but the side attachment can accidentally come off too easily."
0,Corona 3 tine hoe review,"I bought these hoes trying to loosen up clay type soil in my yard, and now I have two broken hoes, they apparently weren't up to the task. I didn't hit many rocks, but was troubled by the tined portion of the tool, that kept pulling out of the end of the tool, and falling onto the ground, requiring it be reinserted. I ended up having one of the hoes fracture off two of the three tines, and the other developed a fracture laterally along the lower plastic retaining sleeve, rendering them both useless. I'd love to be able to return these for a refund, since I had to go to the local big box store and purchase a better constructed steel cultivator/tined rake to finish the job. I don't recommend anyone purchase these unless they can redesign the tool to retain the working end of the device that can only slip into the plastic retaining sleeve, and it kept falling out then fell apart-very annoying!"
0,Would be good as an episode of American Justice on TV .. but not a movie,"As an episode of American Justice with Bill Curtis on TV, this would have proven very good.After all, one of the worst things any of us can imagine is being wrongly imprisoned for something we really did not do.Documentaries that make us aware of this problem and how to improve accuracy of convictions with new technology is a good service.So why was this bad as a movie ?Perhaps it is our knowledge of the activism that people like Susan Sarandon and Danny Glover are often involved in that makes this feel less like a serious portrayal of these stories and more like the audience is being preached at.As an episode of Bill Curtis - American Justice, it would have been good.As a movie staged to look and feel like the stage play it was based on, this simply did not work as a movie."
1,Works Great,I have been using this product for over 3 years and it works great. I will continue to use it daily for the foreseeable future.
0,deserves half a star for performance and a negative one for the company for sending duplicate stuff.,It was clearly cheating. The blender worked for precisely 3 months and then died. I called Cuisinart and an extremely rude customer service representative answered the phone and told me to find a number on the blender which is not there.There is one simple explanation and it is that they sent me duplicate stuff .
1,Unexpected gem,I am a part time librarian who stumbled into this book. I recommend this entrancing story to all my friends.
1,Fall in love hearin' this,"Maaaan... I'm really sad there's no new releases from Alfonzo... The song Slow Motion has a history with me and my dearest friend... a dream that came true!!When You're Ready is another great one and he even displays some more talent with a sax performance in another track! This is a perfect soundtrack for that special night...I definitely recommend this album, your girlfriend is gonna love it!"
1,Fun Summer Reading,This is a good book that should be read poolside. Ya gotta agree with his description of vegitarians as people scared of life.
1,Great for kids and adults!,"If you want some fun music that won't drive you up a wall, make you feel like you're 2 or send you screaming from a room, this is a great CD! Not your traditional kids music but so much more fun! There's a great variety of musical styles and they are just fun songs to hear over and over. If you've seen his videos on the Disney Channel you'll know what to expect. Really great - can't say enough about how good the music and lyrics are. Check it out!"
1,My favorite vegan cookbook!,"I've been vegan for about 4 years now, and I've been cooking all of my meals for 2 or 3. I've spent over $100 on a shelf full of vegan cookbooks. This one is the best I own. It's the only cookbook I have that has recipes that make food that's outright better than anything I ate before I went vegan! Ever since I started making my own vegan pizzas, I absolutely stopped missing the greasy things that I'd been getting delivered, and the pasta recipes here are the best I've ever had.The only problem with this book is that the recipes can take a while to prepare. If you're not a big fan of cooking, this probably isn't the book for you. But if you're glad to spend an hour in the kitchen making a meal and want to have some great vegan food, this book is a must!"
0,incorrect listing description,"Why does the title of the listing say (1969)? Didn't know it was going to be a modern (2007) version. Also, the above editorial review is a review of another completely different disc. Actually the first disc has Seth Green and is the Letter of the month Club brought to you by R and 18. Second disc is Furry Red Monster Parade brought to you by F and 6. Someone should sort this out so that buyers can receive what they anticipate. I bought this specifically because it said it had Spanish language audio option...NOT so at all."
1,"A question for you,","The Nightfly. As if you came here expecting to find a bad review. A few simple clicks is all it takes for you to be in posession of (even if not the absolute finest album of all time, then the second). Once you play this I believe that you'll find yourself hummin or singin it more times than you do all of your other music. Oh, I think I forgot to say how much I like this collection of songs. P.S. I thought I could do this in less than 20 words. Do not click away from here. Buy this album. Trust Me. Would I lie to you?"
0,"Northrup, Move Over!","Because there are REAL women's literary health guides out there. I personally suggest Our Bodies, Ourselves from the Boston Women's Health Collective. Instead of shoving unfounded, bias, and conservative information down your throat like Northrup does, it clearly explains issues pertaining to any woman of any age or background. I have extreme remorse for any woman turning to this book for tolerance and understanding concerning our bodies, minds or choices (especially the choice to have an abortion). I feel like work does nothing but spread harmful, untrue information instead of the facts. Northrup's ""wisdom"" is best kept inside her head."
1,Nice entertaining movie that's not just for kids,"This movie's all right. It's not GREAT or anything, but it's fun to watch on an afternoon when you have nothing else to do. Jennifer Connelly did a very good job as Sarah, although there's something kind of strange about seeing David Bowie singing with goblin puppets and waving his arms around. He's not exactly threatening...But never mind that. This movie is a whole lot of fun no matter what your age, it's not just for kids."
1,I can't believe this worked - it's awesome,"I thought I was going to have to replace my Sony DVD player becasue I could not get through a movie without it hanging up or skipping. So, for $4.95, I figured I'd try this first. Instant improvement! - I rarely get this lucky. You can believe other positive reviews if your problem is a dirty lense, like mine was."
1,Simple. Good.,"My brother and I started looking at watches at the same time because our friend revealed how handy they were if you're hiking and don't want to carry a cell phone around.After browsing the internet, my brother was convinced that he needed a $200.00 atomic military-grade watch. I thought it looked great, but I went with this classic G-shock instead. I spent $40.00.We both got our watches. His is fancy, has a pretty big face, and a bunch of features he doesn't seem to use. It's fit for deep sea scuba-diving, which he doesn't do.Mine is simple, tells time, and I can set it to an atomic clock myself. Mine looks good, has an alarm, and a stopwatch and it can get wet and take a beating.I feel I made the better choice."
0,Waste of Money,"I thought i already reviewed this POS. I wasnt expecting much at all but it wasnt even practical. The only way i see this fitting on anyone, is if there mouth is completely deformed. worst Halloween product ive ever wasted my money on"
1,Greatest pointing device / mouse,"I love this thing. I've purchase two, one was re-manufactured because Logitech quit making them. Both still work, I just wanted a backup. It serves well as a portable USB mouse, a presentation controller for PowerPoints, and has a built in red-laser pointer as well. It has worked in large and small classroom where I may be 25 feet or more from the receiver. It is a true plug-and-play, no software to load. I teach college and have used one of these for well over ten years."
0,Not Worth the Paper it is Printed On,"I was sadly disappointed with this book. It is FAR from historically accurate, and the author seems to be rather fixated on sex and variations of sex. I was really excited to read a book from Dinah's viewpoint, I thought that was a very original take, and I really enjoyed the prologue. After the prologue, the novel's redeeming value ended. I was hoping for something even remotely edifying, but ended up feeling a bit sick. Hopefully someone else will read this review and not bother reading this book."
0,"One good song, the rest are awful","The first two songs on this CD, ""Murder on the Dancefloor"", and ""Take Me Home"" are fun disco numbers. The live version of ""Groovejet (If This Ain't Love)"" is okay, but I'd much rather listen to the studio recording. The rest of the songs are worthless. Their style is completely different from the upbeat disco number I expected, and nothing like the wonderful ""Groovejet"". The music is all syntho-pop that sounds like it is being played on a [...] keyboard. [...]"
0,"Slooow, with recording dynamic problems","I bought this in the two cd incarnation: Requiem, Pelleas et Melisande, Dolly, Melodies, Pavane. So the mastering may not be the same but the cd does not indicate any remastering.It's tedious. Giulini takes things very slow. The recorded dynamics are not good and I found myself running to my receiver turning it up and down -annoying. Yes, Battle has a pretty voice but it also has a hardness to it that I don't like. I prefer Lorraine Hunt (Lieberson) in Pelleas.If you want the quiet one, more in line with what Faure wrote try Cambridge Singer's on Collegium. For the suped-up mass orchestra version, I've enjoyed Wilcock's/Leger on EMI, Cluyten's on EMI, and Amsernt on London/Decca."
0,Bad Package,"Hopefully the movie works, the box was not in good shape, plastic shredded and the paper cover has come out. Will have to replace the case/box."
1,Fun (but very short) Eve Dallas for the holidays...,"This 90-page novella (similar to the later ""Interlude in Death"") was published as a thin paperback to tide diehard Eve Dallas fans over the holidays at the close of 1998. In ten slim chapters, you don't get much back-story or character development, but the usual cast (Roarke, Peabody, et al) are all on deck to catch a murder discovered on Christmas morn, with the hope of a solution prior to the dawn of the new year. The plot gets going in a hurry as pinned to the dead body of Judge Wainger is a list of principals, including Dr. Mira and Lt. Dallas, responsible for sending murderer David Palmer to prison in an earlier story. Eve soon discovers Palmer's escaped prison and sets out to warn and protect others on the list of six intended victims, Eve herself the ""coup de grace""."" The hunt and chase are sustained until the very last page, giving us a typical hard-to-put-down outing by J.D. Robb - short, but sweet !"
0,Not su much...,"Nothing new in this book, same talking points that she (as well as all of her little rabid bloggin buddies) have been putting out there for the last couple years. She wants to make you pay for this stuff? I already feel cheated because I bought the book. Can I get a refund?I used to consider myself independant, after hearing her and her sheep spew hate all over the internet (and FOX News...well, don't reall think it's news)I lean more towards the democratic pary. Malkin, mission accomplished."
1,Wonderful CD!,I love this CD! It's been so long since I've heard this music and I'm enjoying it very much!
1,Wake Up,"I am an extremely heavy sleeper and my biggest fear in life is dying. My second biggest fear in life is over sleeping and being late for a meeting or work. I hate that feeling.What I like to do with this device is place it right under my pillow or in a pocket. When the sonic alert goes off, it's so loud and shocking, I wake up screaming ---- that's how good it is.I've had this for 3 years now and I've yet to change the batteries. I take this baby with me whenever I travel."
1,Needed them!,Love it-No! But I did need them and glad I was able to find them. Went to a lot of stores and couldn't find them.
1,Worked fine,"The filter arrived in good time. It first appeared too large for the unit, but it squeezed in OK and is working fine."
0,CMM1000 a Waste of Money,"I have had this mower for two years. It has never mowed properly, even after repairs. It dies constantly, won't cut even normal grass growth, and definitely can't be lowered enough to mulch as it just won't cut the grass without dieing. This product is the worst item I have ever owned, and I will be going back to a gasoline powered mower before the summer starts."
0,hmmmm......,"If you're an FF fan like me, watch it once, to see what it's like, but trust me, it's no good The animation is low quality, the story's based on FF5 but nothing like FF5 at all really, and it's sort of more for little tykes Basically it's nothing like Final Fantasy at all"
1,"excellent deal, if i had gotten a copy yet!","I got the incredible surprise of a free year of Wired after making some purchases in Amazon. I was sooo excited, but its been more than a month since i received the offer but no magz in the mail yet.Thanks for the year subscription i think it is a great way to support the written media, plus this mag is excellent.Thanks Amazon!"
1,Great Information For Criminal and Civil Case Forensics,"There are many books on computer forensics investigations and incident response, but you won't find too many that tell you what you need to know to take the results of those forensic investigations and make it stand up in court. A Guide to Forensic Testimony (The Art and Practice of Presenting Testimony as an Expert Technical Witness) is an excellent book on this subject. Fred Chris Smith and Rebecca Gurley Bace share their knowledge and experience of the legal system and what it takes to make your computer forensic evidence stand up in court and what you need to do to sell yourself as an expert witness and stand up to cross-examination. The book covers a lot of legal technicalities as well as ethical and professional issues.(...)"
1,Great Product,This pedometer is small enough not to be bothersome and clips nicely on a pocket. A great way to make sure you are getting (or NOT getting) enough exercise.
0,Didn't Asimov already write this one?,"Just from reading the reviews, I can see what is in the book that is ""Foundational"" simply rehashes, storyline-wise, the two pre-foundation books Asimov wrote. No. Hari is dead, both of them. Let them rest in peace."
0,not until they have enough books and at reasonable prices,"It sounds wonderful, but after searching for Kindle versions of books that I own, and would like to carry with me digitally, and for others that I'd like to read, there're just not anywhere near enough books available at this time and the ones that are available are too high-priced for a digital version that would have to be viewed on such an expensive piece of equipment. If there was a bigger/better selection and the books were not so expensive, this sounds as if it would be a dream come true. I think that I'll wait a decade or so until Kindle catches up and can provide me with books that I would enjoy at a reasonable price."
0,Not particularly informative or entertaining,"Basically this book was a dissapointment. Written by a well meaning but hapless couple who seem more interested in putting down stakes in a live-aboard community than cruising. I knew going in that there would be scant information on the technical aspects of sailing and cruising but I was at least hoping for some enlightenment on on-board living. It is replete with lame advice like 'try to shop around for the best fuel prices' and other obvious tidbits. The live-aboard etiquette section was quite interesting although the description of the lifestyle seemed more like squatters than cruisers. If your goal is to get on a boat and go places and do things, this book is not your cup of tea."
0,DO NOT BUY,"Do NOT buy this game! The Longest Journey by itself is fine but Dreamfall is a disaster and a waste of money. What little we saw of the game before it crashed looked good. First it wouldn't run on my son's brand new PC because it's Vista. Then it wouldn't run on my 2 yr old laptop because it isn't the right video card. The right video card is a very, very small list so your chances of having it are slim. The Aspyr Technical Support is unbelievable bad! Their answer to everything is ""we do not support that, check back later"". What a waste! Just buy Dreamfall for the X-box and save yourself the aggrivation."
1,Great supplemental book for teachers and learners,"This book might look out-of-date, but it is an excellent book for high-school aged students/teachers learning French. You can easily supplement other texts with some very interesting readings and exercises. As noted in the introduction, the readings are ""diversified and will appeal to most students"" and ""students can really communicate what they think, feel and believe."" I've never seen a book that has so many good topics that will appeal to both girls and boys."
0,would buy for $1,"Cute story but incredibly cheaply made book. Small, thin cover and pages held together by a couple staples. The print was crooked and runs off the side. Definitely not worth $17.00!!"
1,The best movie ever!,"Okay,maybe not the best movie ever but certainly the comedy of the year.The movie perfectly portrays the life of Andy Kaufman,very little facts were changed for the movie.Jim Carry's performance can almost be descibed as brilliant,one begins to think Carry actuallyis Kaufman.I perfect choice for anyone who loves Kaufman.Carry,or a good comedy."
0,not for the pro chef,"the book has alot of ideas that are photographed step by step, but apart from a handful of ideas, the examples given are kitsch and outdated, great as a conversation piece at a boring home cocktail party, but for a pro chef - forgettaboutit."
0,Great...IF they stayed on,"I bought these for my cat two days ago and we are on day three. I applied the Soft Claws to her front nails (4 to each foot) and held her the requisite five minutes to allow proper drying time. She ripped two off the first day, two the second day, and three today. It seems to me that if this product did its job then they would not be able to come off so easily. What a disappointment and waste of money."
0,If only they didn't die so quickly...,"I've been using this model for years, but recently it seems like the build quality has gone way down. 4 pairs have died on me in the last two years. The most recent one died after less than 2 months of use. In all cases, one of the ears stops producing sound. Too bad because otherwise I really liked these earphones."
0,CAN'T HARDLY WAIT!!!,"I can't wait until this current trend of wimpy, lackluster, pop music runs it's course and we can hear real country music again. This is a prime example of what happens when you get all your musical inspiration by listening to the Young Guns soundtracks. Folks, do yourself a favor and buy Robbie Fulks."
0,customer service,"Living in Los Angeles must be the ""out back"" to Paslode, I purchased the tool with the understanding that nails and fuel cells could be purchased at places like Lowes and Home Depot or at best at local tool outlets. I have yet to find a retailer that sell the 18 guage nail, some do sell brads. I had to have the fuel cell UPS'ed from Oxnard Ca. I went on line and discussed the problem with Paslode. They could care less, they insist that fuel cells and nails are available(but they wouldn't sell me any????. So I continue to call tool supply stores and check larger retailers. The Paslode catalogue ""on line fastener section"" does not even refer to the nails in question. As far as performance, when using brads it works adequatly. So to any and all of you that are considering the purchase of this tool make sure that accessories and supplies are available Would I buy another produce-----NO."
1,I like it,"The product is as advertised. I am satisfied with the DVD, good value for the price. I would buy it again."
0,Cheap,The screws to sight in the laser were stripped would be nice I was able to at least try to sight in but no going to waste a little more money to get a better one you should too!
1,"To me, it's the best Limp Bizkit CD to date........","I've been waiting and waiting for this release since sometime around independence day this year, probably just as much as any other Limp Bizkit fan out there. And then month after month it was delay after delay ...until finally today! And to start it off by saying I'm not disappointed at all. Every track on this cd minus the remix of ""Rollin'"" is good, and great in some cases ,as far as my opinion goes. It kinda picks up where the first 7 or 8 tracks of Signifigant Other left off, if thats of any help to you. My favorite tracks are probably ""Hotdog"" and ""Boiler"". So here's a 4 star, would be 5 start rating, to in my opnion, the best Limp Bizkit CD yet released............."
1,The best book ever. Period.,My title says it all. I have read this book 27 total in 2 years. It is truly the best book ever written.
1,"Reveiw from ""The Hot Shot""","Hey! Whats Up? I loved this book, Click Here. It was entertaining and a wonderful in all sorts of ways... One reason I liked it was, because in 2 years in going in 7th grade. But in are school district middle school starts in 6th grade, not 7th. Back to the story. Last year I was on a select soccer team, the a team to be exact. This year i tryed out and didn't make it.. all my friends did. I cryed for DAYS. I didn't make it because i wasnt good enough, it was a political reason. Yes, my stories not like Erin's but it relates.Erin Swift, is going to 7th grade. Uh Oh... Her and her Best friend Jilly are in different tracks! On the first day she gets to school and punches a girl in the face for calling her ""Pinnocio."" Well, i'm not going to give away the story, but, what i can give away that this book is GREAT!~The Hot ShoT~"
1,Great Starter to the Series,"Horse Crazy is a great book! I own all three cover versions of the book. It starts out with Stevie complaining about the fact that her mother won't pay for the MTO trip and gets the idea to start a odd-job business. Then, Carole meets Lisa who is a new rider. Stevie and Carole are BFFs and Lisa doesn't like Stevie at first, but soon they are best friends and make the Saddle Club. Overall, it's a great book. I recommend it. Like most books, it has a few down points. There are more exciting Saddle Club books (101 books in all!) and some of the facts in the book are a little too outrageous like Veronica riding a stallion and Carole being able to ride it too. As a 12 year old, I don't see them being experienced enough. Still, GET THIS BOOK!I recommend other books in the series like Driving Team, Dude Ranch, Show Horse, Show Jumper ect, too. <^~"
1,Morality and History,An excellent novel that represents the reality of moral questions that faced so many during the Holocaust. Maimie's actions seem so easy to condemn at times and yet so disturbing to the reader who is forced to asked themselves about their own actions during such circumstances. Stark's use of flashbacks to tell the story is first rate. A thought provoking read.
1,PhD - piled high and deeper is painfully funny,"ok, so it may not be so funny if you haven't done the post graduate life avoidance routine, but if you have, it's so funny it hurts. it's the perfect primer for those considering an advanced degree!"
0,Extremely trite.,The author displays very little knowledge of the scientific issues he discusses; his knowledge of the relevant history is even more spotty. It is a work of distressingly low quality.
1,Amazing Ballad - You Can Have Me Anytime,"This one ballad - You Can Have Me Anytime - is so beautiful, its indescribable.Isn't it time you KNEW!"
1,It's great if it's what you're into.,"If you're the kind of gamer who can enjoy lots of ass-kicking without much in the way of plot, and like your single-player games to be pretty hard, you'd have a hard time doing better than Trap Gunner. It offers a lot of ways to kill the other guy, and is terrific in single or two player. There's not a lot in the way of plot or diversity, so I can't think of much to say. There are a pretty wide variety of traps and pickups, but it's essentially always the same idea- use a wide variety of devices and weapons to kill your enemy before the reverse happens."
0,BORING!,"We hated this movie.... We were told that this movie was good, but NO WAY. BORING, don't waste your time"
0,Incomplete,A sampling of their biggest radio hits but not seems incomplete. Other collections are more thorough.
0,Big enough for what?,This is a neat item but so very very small. It has only the capacity for maybe banknotes and a credit card but it cannot accommodate a modern car key - the ones with the remote functions for the central locking and security system - precisely the item most in need of keeping dry.
1,very practical,This is one of the best marriage books available. I highly recommend it. It is very practical. The book doesn't just tell you problems but shows you how to have a great marriage.
0,Horrible,"This cd lacks twistas original style that brought him up. This cd is nothing what people remember as the real Twista. If you liked the cd kamikaze then you will probably like this cd, because it is as stupid as you are."
1,Best gadget I've bought in years,"I've been using Skype for years and more recently, SkypeOut as well. After a horrendous landline bill - and aware of the $30 Skype offer for the US and Canada - it was time to explore reducing the landline bill to a minimum. I did want to keep the landline for incoming calls.I researched several alternatives but settled on the Netgear SPH200D. It is a wonderful gadget: good voice quality, comfortable to use, a snap to install and even the ring doesn't irritate.It would be great if the software permitted one to add multiple numbers to a contact but for the moment each Skypeout contact you add has to have a separate number. You also need to make sure that you add '1' for US numbers. If not, you will land up with contacts around the world and be mystified as to why you can't get through to the right number.We're delighted with this product and look forward to going to theater on the savings."
0,Unbelievable,"My English professor read a piece from this so-called ""book"" -- more like a manual on how to ruin your child's life -- to gauge our reactions to it, and the entire class was disgusted. One girl was in tears, as her father employed the kind of brutal and sick tactics detailed in this book all through her childhood.Barnes and Noble have the right idea by removing this book from its shelves, and I should hope that Amazon would follow suit. Anyone who uses this book as some sort of parenting guidebook should have the methods used on them in turn."
1,Highly Recommended,I purchased this book from a Barnes and Noble bookstore that is also a university bookstore and I am glad that I did. I was impressed by the way Kim engaged questions regarding identity and society. He conceives individual identity as necessarily tied to group identity. I was glad that he used creative approaches to illustrate this point in light of historical evidence and cultural contexts. This book is highly recommended!
0,Heating and Air Conditioning,I try to know how to do this application to buy the book on shopping but something I don't understand if my card was right if anything happen I don't know if it safe to used my credit card and I hope you with send me the book if my card alright
0,like [not very good],"I love Aaron and Nick Carter but Leslie is the most untalented singer ever! The only reason she got a record deal is because of her brothers. Not only can she not sing on the CD but in concert she is terrible. My friend and I when to an Aaron Carter concert last summer and she was one of the openning acts. We were cracking up when she started singing because she couldn't sing at all. I am sure Leslie is talented, just not at singing, she should leave the singing to her brothers."
0,THIS IS THE SUCKIEST BOOK EVER!! DO NOT READ!!!,"This book was SOOOOOOOO boooring. It was so bad, that I had to put post it notes telling me what was going on when I fininshed a chapter. DANGER!!! IF YOU READ THEN YOUR MIND WILL BE POISENED. THIS IS THE WORST BOOK ON THE MARKET!!!!!!!!"
1,Satisfied,"I having been using this light for several weeks and am happy with it. I am a daily bike commuter (over 40mi daily)and usually both directions are in the dark. This is light is part of an armament of lights I use, and I think it is effective high above the road on the back of my helmet. My only issue is that I carry a small backpack which partially obscures the light when I am in an aggressive posture. Sitting up higher or dropping the bag lower helps.Overall, very good product so far and no complaints. I look forward to seeing how it handles the rain and colder weather."
0,Hard to read if you don't know the series,"I'm a Candace Bushnell fan (Trading Up and 4 Blondes), but I've never seen Sex and the City the TV series. I found this book impossible to get into. It was a bunch of disjointed paragraphs and bold headings that jumped through past and present time and seemed to change narrators. I was never sure who was talking or what was going on, but reviewers who love the show seemed to be able to recognize the inspiration for certain espisodes, so it appears to only make sense as a companion to the TV series.I recommend this book only to people who are looking for more as fans of the TV show. If you are a book lover or a fan of Bushnell as an author, stick with her latest works or other great books about Manhattan life."
0,Where is the ROCK!,I ordered this movie thinking The Rock was the star as in the first two movies. I was very dissapointed and could not watch this movie as it was so dumb and corny I am glad it only cost $.99 I still would like a refund of that. Don't waste you money no matter what the cost!
0,Missing episodes...?,My husband and I are avid fans of the office and I bought him these DVDs for Christmas. Unfortunately it appears that we are missing one of the episodes from season 7.
1,"As good as their last, but with a different sound.","In earshot's second album ""two"" their sound begins to evolve, and the tracks seem more upbeat. There are many enjoyable songs on this album, I recommend this to anyone who enjoyed earshot's previous album, as well as fans of the genre."
1,So many uses!,"I love this and have used it for many different things. The stickiness holds pretty well, though seems to diminish over time."
1,Handy,"This is a handy tool when you need to cover something like sugar cookies that need to go into the frig for an hour or overnight. You don't have to dirty another bowl, just put the lid on and go. If you make up some mashed potatos and want them to stay warm while finishing the rest of your meal, put the cover on and keep going. It is also good for those summer days when you might have that pesky fly flying around, or your pets running through the house and hair drifting around, just put the cover on and your food is safe."
0,Sooo tiny,"Even though the purpose of these earrings were for my 13 yr old daughter .. she asked for stud earrings, however, they are barely visible. I was very disappointed when I opened the box. Also the backing on one of the earrings bent very easily when we took them out of the packaging."
0,horrible,"i sent this back , i ran it for 3 days and nothing not one drop of moisture in a very damp basement. the noise was so loud you could not hear the tv or the phone ring and it was two rooms away."
1,'Still Standin' Stevie!!!,"Awesome mixes of a classic song - as a DJ, definitely will put this one to good use... like others have said, not something you want to ride around and listen to too much else you'd get sick of the song itself - haha! BUT the different takes on this already awesome, timeless song are FUN for sure - definitely a keeper!"
1,He's Done it Again!!!,Shatner has written yet another wonderful Star Trek book! Spectre was all that I had looked forward to and so much more. I am a big Voyager fan so this just went so way over the top. The mirror universe characters are so like this one I believed that Paris was our Paris!! The one thing that I really liked in this bokk a lot was Teilani. She is a great match for Kirk and I hope to see them get married in the nex book. Now as all books there is one thing that is wrong. In this case it is the ending. . . or should I say no ending?!?!?! Once again Shatner leaves us on edge to wait another 10 months for his next book .. Sure hope he can write fast!
1,Good grinder,"The grinder is a bit on the loud side when it starts but as the beans grind it quiets down a bit. I wouldn't try to use it while anyone was asleep in the house but for the office it's perfect. The grind is semi-fine, perfect for the Aeropress. I would recommend this grinder for coffee beans."
0,Dangerous,"Dangerous product! Please do your research before taking colloidal silver, as this can do permanent damage."
0,Expensive,"From experience I would recommend purchasing a Bowflex with the 310 or 410 upgrade included. I quickly outgrew the 210 pound ""entry level"" model."
0,when it came it was white. 7 days later it was brown,when it came it was while. 7 days later it was brownI bought for a sound dampener alternative. Not that good but did ok. color changed right away
0,"Total fail!!! Can I get a refund, I've killed more flies with a rolled up newspaper. Took 4 days for it to catch one --- one!!","Total fail.Have an issue with flies. Usually get them once a year, spray the windows and no more. This year not the same. So I bought this and a fly zapper. This took 4 days to catch one. Avoid."
1,A Book for Dog Lovers,I liked this book because the way the author described the way the boy felt about his dogs was amazing. The way the book described how the dogs protected the boy from everything even if it meant losing their own life was very meaningful. And the way the author showed what one dog felt for another was also vwonderful. I definetly recommend this book.
1,I loved Who Killed Doc Robbin,"I really enjoyed waiting for this movie! Many people have rated this movie as bad, but I disagree. It has made my sister and I laugh. It keeps you guessing, and it reminds me of the little rascals."
0,"Bad story, poor acting, this movie just sucks!","With much anticipation I watched this movie on DVD and after about 10 minutes became really bored. Anyone who claims they didn't get bored by the first 10 minutes of four ladies playing Mahjong is simply lying, unless he/she is a Mahjong fanatic. The plot never picks up, and I was simply amazed by how bad the actors are. Tony Leung never got into his character, in or out of bed, and he's just incredible as a ruthless traitor, and the young lady, while attractive, simply does not know how to act."
0,???????,"Besides the impressive animation of the film (for its time), I did not enjoy this movie at all. Maybe its because I could not grasp the movie's concept. (????). Either way I recommend ""Lain"" over this! What's up with the children who obviously suffer fromprogeria? I don't get it!"
1,GREAT,no words can give this book justice!! had me on the edge of my seat feeling as though I knew the the people!! Best book i have ever read
1,Just what I was looking for,I have a salon and was needing a container for the needles from our permanent make up services. This is just right!
0,Absolutely awful!,The packaging of this DVD is very misleading. I assumed I was buying a series by the renowned Discovery Channel. This is a cheap knockoff. The video is horrible and the english translating is worse. Don't waste your money!
0,Pretentious writing...,"Pretentious writing and dated view point. I mean saying the native americans are cursed... what's up with that? I was stunned to read this. I shudder to think what he would have to say about the African race, or the Chinese, or the Greeks... for that matter, what about the Italians, or the Koreans... Then I realized the book was copywritten around 1915... I guess that was the opinion of the day back then. But nearly a hundred years later, surely no sane person is walking around thinking any physical race is cursed. Are we not all children of God. This is something I would not want my children to read, nor could I in good conscious recommend this to a friend. I can't believe any church would endorse such racist teachings. On a positive note - the author's academic knowledge regarding Christ seems pretty sound. However, I stopped reading at the first racial slur. I wish I could delete this book from my cloud account."
1,5 stars,"This book is very informative and I enjoyed using it for my criminology class. I enjoyed the extra excerpts/ highlights in each chapter about different foreign affairs, laws, and cohort studies, etc."
0,Why the Russian Lettering?,"I HATE it when (for ""artistic"" purposes) the Russian lettering is used, only having to mix with English so it is some-what phonetic. It is super pretentious.Oh yes, can I add the music is awful. About as pretentious as the Russian lettering."
1,This book is impeacably documented and extremely compelling,"Judith Reisman makes an extremely compelling case for the impact the Kinsey studies have had on the Law and culture of the world. It is clear from the material found in the Kinsey books themselves that some data was obtained by illegal experimentation. Critical terms such as marriage were redefined by the Kinsey team to manipulate the data and arrive at a contrived and desired conclusion. This book is a must read for anyone interested in the state of the culture, particularly in the US."
0,Causes a MSVCRT.DLL error that is not correctable,"I have been a fan of Norton for a while and purchased Norton Internet Security 2003 to upgrade my 2002 version. The new product is very similar to 2002 with the annoying exception of not being able to scan my hard drive. I consistently get a msvcrt.dll error and Symantec is unable to correct this. If you look on Symantec's technical support bulletin board, there is a large number of people with the same problem. The solutions provided by Symantec do NOT work. This seems to be a problem with the programming and not my computer. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT UNTIL THEY RESOLVE THIS PROBLEM."
1,Cellfood skin care oxygen,I like this product. I use it with every meal. My system feels better and sleeping is also better.
1,Acceptable,"The book was in the shape that it was described. There was a lot of writing but for the price that I paid for it, I cannot complain."
0,NOT WORTH IT,"This is a classic case of a studio repackaging something to make some extra coin.The print looks great, however you cannot play it in 16:9.All the other extras are available elsewhere for half the price. All your really paying for here is a velvet plastic box and some miniature reproductions of production letters, stills, and sketches.Spend your money elsewhere."
1,don't worry about sticking,This is a great pan. with a good weight. don't worry about the sticking problem mentioned; just read and follow the directions. this is a great buy.
1,A Classic Rock Christmas,"I have been waiting impatiently for this release because it includes a brand new song from Survivor and the CD is everything I expected and more. From Survivor's Christmas Is Here, to Father Guido Sarducci with Santa's Lamnet this CD has something for everybody! Fantastic original songs from Styx, REO Speedwagon and Eddie Money fit well with some classics like The Twelve Days Of Christmas by Tommy Shaw and Jack Blades. A must-have for any classic rock fan!"
0,It could be better...,It could have been a lot better. I finished it without cheat codes in a day or so and then it sat on the shelf until I traded my PS2 in for a PSP.
0,Roots Rock Reggae in Germany last tour 1980,Lovely show .........but not so good recording High price for the low quality....also missing the opening act from the I three's and key songs from the show cut from the disc???
0,Positive Magic,"This book was nothing like I expected!! It was recommended by a friend ... however, I just couldn't get into it."
1,great play alone toy,"I bought this for my 6 yr old and she loves it! Travels well and is great for ""cause and effect"" skills. You must move the ice cream truck out of grid lock to win."
1,Great on floors.,I clean houses for a living and I have to say this is the best tool I've found for floors...Large and small. It is not so good on carpets.I hand mop several large hardwood floors and this vaccuum leaves the floor completely dust and dirt free making my job a lot easier. Because of the small size and the hose attatchment I can get into smaller spaces thus eliminating moving some large items which may mar the floor.Very lightweight and powerfull. I have two clients who have purchased one themselves after trying mine. I reccomend it to anyone who has trouble stooping with a dustpan or hauling around heavier floor cleaners that do half the job.
0,Regrettably Regrettable Ugh,"I just wasted 4 bucks and almost 2 hours of my life I can't get back. I am definately adding this to my list of top 10 worst movies of all time. Don't watch this unless you like weird akward movies. It's not even a romantic movie. Emma is fairly normal but depressed and Will is happy but coo coo. He talks to himself and stocks Emma. I cringed watching this. I was bored and/or weirded out the whole time. I kept watching and waiting for it to get better, since I spent money, but nope! It never got better."
0,What happened to Miss Thang,"This album is a big step backwards for Monica. What a shame, since her first album was so good. Teeny boppers who don't know the old Monica might like this album, but older fans who liked her early stuff will surely be disappointed. There's absolutely no question that her first album was far superior in every way than this one. Why didn't she keep it real? Why, why, why? And whatever happened to this girl? It's been 4 years since this album, and I haven't heard anything new about her."
0,No stars,"This book is utter bs. Why are we not allowed to rate with no stars? Does Coulter deserve ""one star"" just for getting published?"
1,great book!,"This book has lots of great examples of dialogs to have with your child to help them develope language at every stage of development. Also there are suggested toys and tips on how to use them. However, the exact toys are hard to find to purchase for yourself. But, you can always find something similar. With each age group, there is also a list of sugggested books--which I really like. This book has taught me a lot."
1,Can't wait for the Glorious Appearing!,Enjoyed this one as much as the first. Hattie needs to go. Her character has gotten tedious. I liked Rayford's character better in the previous books. I wish the next book was being released sooner. It's difficult to wait to read more!
0,Never Used It,"I was able to assemble this correctly. The parts would not line up, so I returned the product. I tried with two units, but could not get either one to assembly correctly. Amazon was good at refunding the purchase price."
1,Classic Slow Jams...,"This double disc set compiled by Philly radio station WDAS FM (105.3), once again shows that a great music can be at your fingertips in a matter of seconds! This set contains so many classic slow jams! You can put this on and just chill out and reminisce! Travel back to a time when music was music...love was love and making love started in the mind...and not on the dance floor or on a stage!On this particular set, you've got the classic, rare cut ""Forever More"" by Enchantment (which isn't even found on their best of CD). You also have the Michael Henderson, Norman Connors collaboration on ""You are my Starship."" The once very popular ""Magic Man"" by Robert Winters & Fall! Yes, it keeps going...and going..with Ms. Phyllis Hyman's ""Meet Me on the Moon."" I really could go on forever...but I will end it with this: If you can, purchase all of WDAS's compilations...they really do a heck of a job picking songs from the past and synchronizing them on disc."
0,I've had 3... and all 3 stopped performing randomly.,"I've purchased 3 of the LinkSys RVS4000's in the last year. The first one worked great for 7-8 months, then suddenly stopped working, wouldn't reset back to factory defaults either. I purchased a second RVS4000 because my config file with all of my settings is compatible with it and had nothing but problems getting the device connected. I'm constantly having to go to my data center to reboot, and restore the device. It's a total pain and I highly recommend you stay away from this device. The only good thing about LinkSys that I can say is- when I called for support I wasnt routed to some International Help Desk... I was going to use a Belkin device to replace the RVS 4000 but since I couldnt understand their foreign support rep, I returned my Belkin router."
0,Not so Cool,This looked like the perfect solution to early morning neck pain. Wrong. What it is is a non-messy alternative to real ice packs that will provide a bit of coolness for a short period of time. Back to the ice bags for me.
0,Just ok!,"I was looking for new authors and came across Lucy Monroe. I love the whole Alpha Male thing and I loved the cover of this book as well as the write up! The sex scene was ok, could definetly have been better. I just did not feel or see the whole Alpha male thing going on! For the most part I thought the book was just ok, maybe borderline boring!"
1,do NOT hesitate....I went from major skeptic to major enthusiastic supporter!,"I hate biopics...the stars are never as interesting or charismatic as the artists they portray and they just come across as second class...TV!well...I passed on this when it ran on the tube...and I WAS WRONG! This is off the hook good...the star gets Elvis...the shyness, the enthusiasm, the desire for fame....the naive little boy in the ever evolving sex symbol package, Randy Quaid is dead on perfect as the Colonel..and the rest of the cast does not dissapoint.I am telling you...the recreations are breathtakingly cool.. these producers GOT IT...and GOT IT RIGHT...this is from a very very hard to please skeptic...Elvis fans will love it...casual fans who may be interested because of all the press on Elvis this week (30th anniversary of his passing)..this would be a great place to learn about The King!"
0,delayed until August,"According to Image Entertainment, who is producing this DVD, the release has been delayed *again* to August 9th."
0,boring schlock,What a waste. Glad I only rented it!The gusy from Buffy & Voyager are in it and still that doesn't even save it. What were their agents thinking?
1,Eye-opening and moving,"A great collection of ""ordinary"" voices from extraordinary times. This book gave me a new appreciation of the hardships, challenges, and even joys shared by those who stayed behind in the Second World War. Reading of the details of daily life in wartime America makes my own parents' experiences clearer to me. I'm left with a great admiration for the quiet strength of these women. Thank goodness, the women are modest, and the editor pulls no ""greatest generation"" claptrap. The power of these memoirs is only greater for that reticence."
1,Inspired to be Manly,"An excellent book with a plethora of thought provoking concepts. Reaches into the the spaces, thoughts and attitudes that help make a man a Man of God. Good reading for anyone interested in understanding how a man should live his life in the will of God."
0,Died after 40 days,"I was very happy with the headphones until one afternoon they stopped working. I played with the controls and modes without luck. I moved them around on my head and they began working again (as if a wire was not making good contact somewhere). The next day they died completely.I called sony since they were still under the 90 day waranty and after two long phone calls they said that they are eligable for replacement. However, they will be replaced only with a refurbished set that is ""similar"", but the person on the phone could provide no details on what kind of replacement this would be.For the price I would expect better service (ie money back, replacement with new unit), and that they would last more than fourty days."
0,Item doesn't work.,"I bought the computer game for my daughter for Christmas, so I didn't try it out right away. When she got it and we tried it out, it didn't work. I wanted to return it but I didn't have the order#. I was very dissappointed."
0,Big Hype!!!!!!,"I used this product for a few months and at first I was feeling really good, but after the month wore off I had to take more and more and it seemed like a constant expensive circleI did take the advice of one of your reviewers and went to the health food store and bought a good probiotic and that made a world of difference and I did save a lot of money and got much better results"
0,Definitions,"First the socialists co-opted the word 'liberal;' now, this socialist is trying to steal the word libertarian from those who believe in individual and economic freedom. This book is an attack. It's an attempt to confuse away the freedom movement by robbing it of its labels. For a real definition of classical liberalism/libertarianism, visit lp.org. Also, there are plenty of real books on freedom in listmania on Amazon, just type 'libertarian.' To the statists: you may pervert our terms, but the power of truth and freedom will not be eschewed from existence."
1,Joe South Greatest Hits CD,Great cd but a couple of the songs are not as good as his old vinyl - but very happy with my purchase as Joe South is hard to get
0,Avoid at all cost,"It is hardly worth commenting on the quality of the film, in this case, since the DVD is so terrible. The packaging states that the film is ""restored and enhanced"". Baloney. It also claims that the DVD contains a whole heap of special features. Double baloney. It contains none, not even an interactive menu. The sound and vision are probably as bad as I have ever seen on a DVD. You can watch this film on You Tube and enjoy better quality. Amazon should not be peddling such rubbish."
0,AAAACK!,"Most reviewers here have hit the proverbial nail on the head regarding Donna Tartt's ""The Little Friend"". I only wish I'd read them before I wasted money and time on this rambling, long-winded, unresolved tome. Hire an editor, Donna baby, please!"
1,Good work,"Duff really takes control and delivers while axel helps out with the classic ""Ain't it fun"".A must for G N R fans"
0,Unapproachable,"Despite an obvious self-consciousness of writing for posterity as a U.S. President and the concomitant need to maintain a certain aloof dignity, U.S. Grant provides candid and illuminating interpretations of the causes of both the Mexican War and the Civil War and the imperatives of slavery, never cavilling in his opinion. He is also careful yet enlightening in his opinions of historical figures of his age. But 90% of his memoirs describe battle movements that are unapproachable to anyone without an intimate knowledge of the field. The average reader thus is left without any way of knowing whether movements were brilliantly inspired, ordinary, or absolute blunders. There is no reason for this, because a great many simplified Civil War maps exist that could have and should have been included in this edition, or, if copyright were an issue, re-drawn. That they were not included is a professional disgrace to the publisher."
1,it works,I have used it in yard work and it supports my knee with no ligaments. I was initially hesitent but nomw i'm sold.
1,Cooking Enthusiast,"We got one as a Christmas present last year, and it looked really neat so we tried it out once the leftovers were gone, and wow, it was GREAT. It's been almost a year, and no problems what so ever. Cleaning the sides is hassle free but the bottom requires some attention. I really see no flaw in the product, as all of our foods have been excellent and trouble free."
0,"If you like flying cat poop, buy this!","I read several reviews before buying this product. They seemes very mixed, but I hate changing the litter box, and I thought, ""Hey, that person who talks about the cat poop flying 10 feet in the air has GOT to be lying!"" Well, sir, that person was not. I, too, have seen the flying cat poop. In fact, the day some hit me in the face was the day I decided to return this!One plus: all the time I spent cleaning the rake and changing the waste receptacles created in me the discipline to sift my cat litter daily. My husband noted, ""Hon, you spend more time fooling with the electric litter box than you did the regular one!"" Littermaid reformed me--now my house smells fresh--and I'm spending the money from the returned litter box at Pier 1!"
0,Read the books instead!,"Being a BIG Terry Pratchett fan doesn't change the fact that the animation is terrible, and the characters lack the details that make them Esme, Gytha and Magrat. All the subtleties are gone.The look of the witches is all wrong; Granny Weatherwax is not intimidating, Nanny Ogg is not naughty, and Magrat, for some reason, is sexy. Of course Christopher Lee is going to be brilliant for Death-- who else would you pick?! But if the rest of the visuals become painful to watch, and the witches are flat, then the video is a waste of time. Read the books!"
0,Battleship,This was so an awful movie! I was really hoping to like it seeing as it was filmed in Pearl Harbor where I'm stationed in US Navy but it was just too outlandish to go with. I can handle the fantasy part of it but they really didn't research the minute details of what goes on in the Navy. Hey at least my 8 year old liked it!
1,"Excellent, but not complete...","I gave this book 4 stars because it is not complete in certain parts. Fortunately I bought the Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun Book from Gerard Metral from a Shop here in Brasil (Actually I bought those books, because a civilian war is iminent here in Rio de Janeiro, and Brasil now have laws prohibiting the selling of Weapons).Well, the Expedient Homemade Firearms is complete with the aquisition of Do-It-Yourself Submachine Gun book, because this book covers important steps that the Expedient Homemade Firearms doesn't cover, like the Parkerization Process, Handgrip manufature and some most technical details.If you wanna make your weapon, buy both books, focus on building the weapon explained in the Expedient Homemade Firearms, and add to it the important details described on Do-It-Yourself book."
0,Bad placement of back tire,"We got this for my daughter when she was 18 months. When she tries to push herself forward, her heels hit the back wheel, and she can't go anywhere. It might as well not have wheels."
1,"Best of the ""Best of"" releases","All tremendous recordings - ""Window In The Skies"" is great! All their biggest hits and unlike Best of 1980-90/1990-00 there are no questionable qualifiers. Even diehard U2 fans will enjoy.Having said all that - U2 is a famous band - not because of these singles but because of the other tunes on each of their albums. They are one of the few - possibly the only band - able to put interesting/enjoyable music on 10-12 tracks almost every time.So...U2's greatest hits are really the albums ""War"" ""Unforgettable Fire"" ""Joshua Tree"" ""Achtung Baby"" ""All That You Can't Leave behind"" and ""How To Dismantle An Atomic Bomb"". Like the great 1960's/1970's rock bands - they are an ALBUM band. Even more than that - they are a band where their music comes to life in concert.The albums and the concerts are where its at for the legions of U2 fans around the globe. Greatest hits albums are a distant second option."
1,Olympus 520,If your looking for a better digital camera to start up with this is the one. I have 6 digital cameras all the way up to [$$$} and are better but they are all Olympus. For one to keep in your pocket when you want a photo this is it.
0,Not Elkind's Best,"Elkind, as always, makes a good case for slowing things down for kids. As a Montessori and Waldorf parent, it's always nice to read ideas in support of trusting a more organic approach to my children's development. However, I didn't feel this book had near the power of Elkind's earlier work, The Hurried Child. The book reads more like a pop psychology text. I was put off by the reiteration of his ideas regarding early childhood and left wanting more support of his theories. I also was hoping the Power of Play would suggest some examples of play and elaborations on ""what comes naturally"" to young children."
0,"Loose connection, doesn't seem to charge iPad","The connector doesn't sit flush with the devices that I've tried it with (iPhone 4, iPod Nano 6G, iPad 1G). Connector still uses push-to-disconnect dock connector, and only one of the pins seems to lock in to the device. Sometimes will come loose enough to disconnect device from computer/wall charger.Also didn't seem to be very compatible with 10W iPad charger. Took longer than normal to bring iPad to full charge from 70%."
1,Gloriously Restored 007 Soundtrack,"John Barry's score for ""You Only Live Twice"" represents some of his finest James Bond music. This evocative 1967 soundtrack has been gloriously restored and expanded, with most of the original score intact. ""Fight At Kobe Dock,"" ""James Bond In Japan"" and the long-awaited ""Little Nellie"" are among the highlights. Another welcome addition to the Barry catalogue."
1,Greatest thing ever!,"When it comes to convenience and efficiency, this workhorse is off the charts! One of the best purchases we've made in awhile. Extremely satisfied!"
0,A horrible book!,"As the mother of four girls, I find this book very disturbing. It is so important to teach girls (and boys) to be confident in who they are and not worried about what other people will think of them. This book gives girls the idea that other peoples' opinions are extremely important and should be considered at long lengths before doing, saying, eating or wearing ANYTHING. The drawings in this book are scary and the scenes where children are laughing at the little girl are heart-breaking. The hidden lesson in the book is way over a child's head."
0,Terrible reliability,"This router/modem is complete garbage.The router frequently reboots itself spontaneously, causing you to intermittenly lose network connectivity.This is a replacement for the last WCG200, which I returned because it did the same thing. This last one, however, would also lock up entirely, requiring you to power cycle it.The spontaneous reboot issue seems to be load based, opening multiple pages or graphics intensive pages seems to trigger it. (I work in an enterprise datacenter, and can't IMAGINE that a device has trouble handling such small loads.) I have contacted Linksys technical support about it a couple of times, and they were remarkably unhelpful, suggesting that I may have recieved not one, but two bad routers, and should exchange them at the store I purchased them from.I do NOT reccomend this product."
1,Howard Hawks' First (and Best) Western,"An unsurpassed cattle-drive epic, director Howard Hawks' ""Red River"" (1948) ranks among the Top 10 sagebrush sagas. John Wayne's superb portrayal of Tom Dunson represented the actor's first complex characterization - well-matched by Montgomery Clift's impressive screen debut as the cattle baron's adopted son. In his 1982 critical guide ""Western Films,"" author Brian Garfield attributed the greatness of ""Red River"" to the fact that ""a lot of people were having good days."" The film truly benefited from an excellent supporting cast (notably Walter Brennan, John Ireland and Harry Carey Sr.), Dimitri Tiomkin's robust score and the stunning cinematography of Russell Harlan. ""Red River"" endures as an American classic."
1,Classic album that sounds awsome!,"I'm not going to waste my time describing this album because I'm pretty sure all AC/DC fans are familiar with it. The thing is that I really don't understand how a reviewer said that this remastered cd sounded bad. The sound is clean and clear. The guitars are more ""alive"" than the original cd version. If you don't own a copy, by all means go buy one. Walmart sells all of the Epic remasters for $9.72. I even saw some of them for $8.64."
0,"If you plan to sit through this, bring a good book.",The story: a confirmed bachelor has a choice between marrying the pig he is currently dating or not. His uncle dies and gives him an ultimatum and a time-limit: marry or lose a fortune. Bachelor looks up every girl he was ever involved with. Too late. They're taken now. He should have married them when he had the chance. He marries the pig.Funny. Ha. Ha. The only bit of amusement is a few minutes of Peter Ustinov as the uncle. Those who watch this will get what they deserve.
1,"Well, four and a half stars!","This is a really good debut album. I saw the band on a trip to LA at the advice of a friend, and also heard a demo tape. Ordinarily, this isn't the type of music I listen to, but I really liked their energy and especially the good marriage of interesting lyrics with serious musicianship. It's raw in a fresh way, but also really polished. The guitar work is serious! When I learned it was available on Amazon, I bought it immediately. I think these guys are gonna go somewhere for sure. Unfortunately, it's hard these days to find this caliber of music on the radio dial. I hope they make it up to San Francisco!"
0,Doesn't even deserve one star!!! **AVOID**,"To be honest, I went into this movie believing it was the ""Hitcher"" which I take responsibility for that as being my fault. So given that, I was expecting a lot. The first two lines of the movie made me realize I had just purchased probably one of the worst low budget movies ever to have been created. The acting was TERRIBLE!! The worst part was the sound quality. No lie, I had to learn how to read lips. I had the volume up full blast and there were times, I could not hear a word that was said. I want to know how this film could be sold! Overall, I would have fell asleep on it, but it was so bad I wanted to see if it could get any worse! Well, it never let me down in that aspect. Take the first review with a grain of salt, as the reviewer must have been the writer himself. Avoid like the plague!"
1,The only Diaper bag I needed,"I can't stand lugging around a huge bag and refused to buy a diaper bag - I found this works just as well. It has a detachable changing pad and fits 3-6 diapers plus lotions and a spare outfit. I breastfed so I didn't need any room for bottles, etc. You can pop this into any other tote and it works great. I store it in the front of my Maclaren stroller and it's the perfect size and weight - I have no issues with tipping the stroller over with a huge & heavy bag."
0,"Flimsy, flimsy....but nice handle","I bought this to replace a cheap one from [name of store] that had finally given up, and does not come close to matching the quality. It is way too flimsy and needs about another 1/2"" in diameter to cover my 12"" pans. Save your money and go get one at your local store."
1,All drums!,"I got this cd about 2 years ago and I'm still listening to it. It's great for practicing hip and pelvic work, and more experienced dancers will be able to do other moves to it. In fact, I think more experienced dancers will benefit the most from this cd. Beginning students will find it too complex and overwhelming, but I would recommend that beginning students start with one easy song and practice movements to it then move on to another cd. If you're a fan of drums and like nothing but drums then this is the cd for you!"
1,XBOX 360 premium edition,"I just got the system today, and I really like it...but to all you out there that haven't bought it yet and want it REALLY bad, take my advice and wait for a price drop....the system is good, (...)"
0,Tedious Ego,"I have to admit that I tried reading this book four times. Each time I would get part way into it and still feel the same, and put it aside. I will read through just about ANYTHING, so I am suprised at myself for this attitude. Quark is seen as insufferable and weak, which maybe a reflection of his true inner self, but it made for tedious reading. I saw a lack of what makes the Frengi character so exciting, his internal and external debate between the ""humane"" and Frengi perspectives of the world. I found not only the Quark character insufferable, but the writing style wordy and insipid. I've read all the Star Trek series books and I put this one down at the bottom of my list with great agony."
0,Analog audio-output?,"I just bought this item because I need something to charge my ipod and I like the fact that it has the audio output jack so I plug my ipod into my car stereo Aux jack. I must said I'm very disappointed due to loud popping noise this thing generate even though I have the volume at minimum and not even plug in my ipod yet. I'm going to return it. I bought this before reading any review, I just noticed Amazon description said ""The auto kit also provides an adjustable amplifier and .125-inch analog audio-output"", can any one verify the output is actually in stereo?"
1,More Hip Openers,"This is Part 4 of a 4 series DVD. While I believe the third DVD (the Dance of Yes and No) requires the first two dvds to build up to the poses....the 4th DVD can be considered a ""stand alone"" (along with the first and second I guess!). The focus of this DVD is to open up your hips and get ""stretched"" to a point where you can do a lotus pose. So DO NOT think you are getting a traditional yoga class of sun salutations, tree pose, twists, wheel, etc...but more like pigeon, twists, and so forth. If you never gotten into a lotus pose, I'm sure the regimen here will get you over the top to do that pose. I unfortunately couldn't on the first two tries, but I felt it. And did feel the DVD was worthwhile.I will say this - as a dude, I'm not a fan of hip openers. I will do it here and there as I realize/feel the benefits. But for traditional like yoga Anusara yoga class...i'll practice with ""Lakshmi Rocks Me"" and ""The Dance of Yes and No"". Still...i can't knock this DVD - it will stretch you!"
0,Third prize in the Creative Writing Class,"An earnest effort but if you want good, cliché free writing, engaging and well drawn characters and an interesting plot line you'll need to avoid this little oddity. Okay if you're on holiday in another country and it's the only book available in English."
0,Seemed too good,"Bought this as a Christmas gift. Seemed miles below the other models in price, and all the reviews seemed encouraging. Bought one for my boyfriend and it died by April. Just after the 90-day warrenty was over. He has gotten it to limp along, but now there are alot of models for the same or lower price. Wish I had waited."
1,A Golden Fuzz Butt Best Seller,"I found Marjorie's collaborative collection of short stories about our beloved rescued golden fuzz butts a wonderfully passionate account of what canine and human life is like when our four legged friends get a second chance at a life they have longed deserved. I brought it to work and by the end of the night 3 of my coworkers had read it through cover to cover. It is hard to put down once you get started. Kudos to Marjorie for sharing with us the ""tails"" of the rescued golden. Every story brought out a different emotion in me."
1,Great TRS cable,"It's exactly what i needed, it works great and nothing wrong with it. Shipping was Fantastic. I would recommend this to musicians looking for a TRS cable"
0,Unsafe For Any Age,"We bought this item for my toddler son. It was truely unsafe from the beginning. Problem is that his face stays underwater and he cannot get his balance. We then tried it on my 4 year old, the same thing happened with him that he could not keep his face above the water. It looks like a good concept, but we did not get the ""SAFE"" feeling from it. Also the velco straps that connect to the shoulder left my son with a dry, rubbed red mark."
0,The limpest cd of them all!,"Limp bizkit must have made this cd in between bathroom breaks at their local pancake house.This cd is appropriatly named,Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog flavored water, because of Fred Durst fondness for beach side cook outs.CS and HGW shows limp bizkits sad descent into the WORLD OF MUSIC NO ONE CARES ABOUT. Let us pray that they realize this and go away forever so people that won't listen to their ""watered down rap rock"" don't have to hear the 7 yr old LB fans crying over the new LB cd they bought with their bubble gum money."
1,good old standard,"Still love the layout of this keyboard. I can't stand typing on a standard keyboard for over a few hours, and this one seems to fit me best ergonomically. It's a little pricey for being so loud (clickity click click), but still my favorite solution."
0,Bottom quality,I just got this comforter set and it does not look like the picture at all. There is no cord trim along the comforter like the picture. The bedskirt is a bottom line quality. The set would worth about $30 max. The comforter is very thin too.
0,rent it before you buy it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,This game has its ups and downs. <br /><br />Here are the ups: the graphics are sweet. The maps are sweet. I played several times online and notice no lag at all. <br /><br />The downs:It doesn't have many controller configuration options.
1,Does the job,"It does work well once you get the hang of how to work it. The brush does work well, but not as smooth and easy as the Evercare Pet Hair Sweeper."
0,green day goes grunge,"I am a huge fan of green day and always have been, but this cd was an all time low for them. They tried a totally new sound, and it obviously didn't go over so well, all in my opinion, ofcourse. I say anything's worth a shot, but this wasn't exactly what they should have gone for. Good luck with your other long-time fans, Green Day! I still love the band, I was just dissapointed with the release."
1,Awesome Disney Movie,"A great Disney movie, the music is wonderful, I watch it over and over many times"
0,Offensive,"This book is a fast read and I did chuckle here and there. But I don't understand why Wilder-Taylor is so disparaging towards mothers who had births they feel great about, enjoyed breastfeeding and co-sleeping, choose to homeschool, use cloth diapers or make their own babyfood.I was looking forward to reading this knowing she has a large following and I usually enjoy ""Mama lit,"" but the writing is flat and uninspiring. She certainly does not foster any sense of inclusion within mothers."
0,You get what you pay for,"If you want a firewire card that will stop working after a couple of months, this should be your first choice! Otherwise, reach a little deeper into your wallet and get a real card from a real brand."
0,Lousiest BSC Book!,"I agree with Good Riddance. I used to like Dawn, but ever since Dawn's Big Move, she's turned into a snooty, self-centered, whiney, little witch. She thinks that she's too good for Connecticut and the BSC, and it was mean of her to not confront Mary Anne about her moving to California. I wish that Mary Anne hit Dawn in the face with that coffee mug! I always liked Mary Anne and she's turned into a brave, assertive girl. It's sad that her only stepsister is moving to California. But I did feel a bit sad that Dawn is moving for good and Kristy has to replace her in the club. But Dawn is an Honorary Member now."
1,"This product works well, with good sound quality.","This product works well, with good sound quality. It is a little hard to understand all the features but that is because they had to cram them all into the small device. I would recommend this product."
0,Great premise with little promise,"The idea of catching butterflies greatly apealed to my 4 year old since she is an avid lover of insects, but the game fell seriously short of my expectations. I agree with other reviewers who cannot get this toy to work effectively even with fresh batteries. My daughter tried for 30 minutes to get it to work, and was thrilled when one or two butterflies would finally flitter out of the elephant trunk. For the money this toy needs some serious modifications to make it a more reliable unit, and therefore worth spending my hard earned money. Also my child has better things to do than wait on a poorly designed game to work."
0,Smell Faintly of Dead Fish - Totally Gross,"I can only speak for the 4 pillows that I briefly owned, (I bought them on a riduculously good sale that was apparently too good to be true) but I do NOT recommend this product. I recommend you stay away.I had these pillows in my house for exactly 20 minutes before they were packed up, ready to be sent back. When you get close to them, they smell similar to how a pond smells. Murky, sickening, vaguely of decaying matter. I can't get them out of my house fast enough."
1,Mustang Car Cover,"I bought this cover for my 2006 Mustang Convertible.My Husband and myself put it on without any problem.It can easely be put on by one person, At this timeso far there are no complaints. We just hadsix inches of snow so we will see how well it held upSo Far So Good. I would reccomend this product toany one. THE PRICE IS RIGHT. AMAZON IS MY FAVORITESHOPPING SPOT, I ALWAYS LOOK HERE FOR MOST OF MYAPPLIANCES, HOME FURNISHING ETC."
0,Bloodless,"""Rendition,"" though boasting a stellar cast of great actors (Jake Gyllenhaal, Meryl Streep, and Reese Witherspoon) only fitfully attains anything approaching human and thoughtful: Reese Witherspoon going off on Meryl Streep about her Egyptian born husband who Streep has sent off and out of the United States to be interrogated for alleged terrorist activity.The rest of this film lumbers along, stopping only to witness grotesque scenes of torture and massacre.The problem here is that director Gavin Hood (of ""Crash"" infamy) does not make enough of a commitment to his material for us to care about what he is presenting. The entire film feels like it is shot behind a scrim which keeps us at arms length emotionally and morally. We watch but we don't care."
0,worx gt not what it seems,I thought I was buying the newer version and is not the case. Battery lasts about 10 min and then has to be recharged. Otherwise might be nice to have if it were the new design with better battery. Wont make that mistake twice.
0,Tanks a lot!,"Kinda disappointed with the book. Disjointed presentation that did not really hold my interest that much. Of course, it was written by tankers of the Third Reich, so I should have expected the presentation as it was."
1,Inspirational and Practical,"This is my favorite. Other books were either too traditional or would be more helpful to people who can knock out walls. Great for people who live in small spaces and want to make the most of it...as a bonus there are some easy and fun do-it-yourself projects in the back of the book, from making neat pillows to a mosaic topped table (which I hope to try one of these days!). Highly recommended."
1,Love's Abiding Joy,I enjoy this series immensely but felt this fourth one was a let down. I will watch the first three again and again but doubt I will watch this one again.
1,"An amazing, well-researched book","In the media furor that has swirled around this book, one thing has become increasingly clear: few people have read the darn thing. Most people seem to be quoting the distorted newspaper articles that have appeared in the last few weeks. This book, based on Churchill's essay ""Some People Push Back: On the Justice of Roosting Chickens,"" is not an attempt to ""excuse"" the 9-11 attacks. Rather, it tries to figure out why they happened, and why Americans seem unable to understand why there's so much global anger directed our way. Using two detailed chronologies, Churchill recounts a long and sordid history of U.S. military assaults on other nations, millions of foreign civilians slaughted by our tax dollars, as well as countless violations of international law perpetrated by our government. Given this well-documented litany of abuse, Churchill's argument that some sort of response was--and is--inevitable makes perfect sense. Read the book!"

1,"Goldmember. Good Movie, Okay DVD","This isn't a review about the actual movie, but the DVD itself. The Austin Powers Movie: Goldmember, was wonderful and very funny. However, the DVD does not live up to the movie. The DVD has several wonderful features in it: The Infinifilm opition which allows you to watch the movie and access speical features that tells you about how the movie was made and the concept of everything. However, there were several features in the DVD that made the DVD worse. First off, unlike most DVD's the DVD was in the Full Screen Version, which cuts off part of the movie itself. Second off, the movie doesn't have subtitles at all, which makes it hard for anyone that can't hear well or that don't know English to watch the movie.Pros:It's Austin PowersInfinifilm FeaturesCons:No SubtitlesFull Screen Version"
1,Wow.,"Seriously, WOW! This is really well done. Informative, interesting, moving, funny (am I allowed to say that about something related to cancer?), easy to watch and loaded with information. Thank you so much for this contribution, it will help the women in our lives and millions all over the world!"
0,Quite a disappointment.,"Based on all the ""professional"" reviews I bought this book and wish I'd saved my money. It wasn't funny, it wasn't even entertaining. I found it tedious and tiring to read and regret even bothering to finish it. Glad he survived it, his childhood, that is and that the catharsis he hopefully achieved in doing so was helpful to him. But it was filled with disgusting people and equally disgusting events, some of them criminal. Best he had shared that privately. So much for book reviewers..."
1,Thus Saith the Lord,"This book is a gift from God. ""Eat your veggies,"" saith the Lord. If you have a pulpit in your home, this book should be on your pulpit.This book is gorgeous, sensual, seductive - and worshipful. The food photography is superlative - a very rare accomplishment for food photography, which is typically mediocre beyond belief, if not horrific.If, like me, you are a compulsive, serial violator of the ""eat your veggies"" rule - and statistics say you probably are - this book will seduce you into compliance."
0,Out of date,This purchase was a waste of money. Travel books are no help at all unless they are current. There was no publish date in the information.
0,Disappointing.,"Maybe my expectations were too high. I read this book because it was recommended by a friend who had also read (and loved) Jeffery Brown's relationship-based graphic novels. I started Blankets expecting to find the same examples of intimacy that I thought were present only in my relationships, but surprisingly turned up in Mr. Brown's as well.I found this novel alternatingly trite and elusive. I was frusterated almost the entire way through, maybe frusterated for him, maybe just frusterated with him.That said, some of the artwork was beautiful."

0,Not A Fan,Positive: The fabric is soft.Negative: My main concern was getting a Duvet cover that fit our down comforter. I measured and looked and looked for a cover that would fit. This listed measurements that seemed to be right on but there is too much cover for the comforter. It drives me nuts having excess fabric. I had to pin the corners on the inside to keep the comforter in place and the buttons come out of their button holes easily. I think the whole experience has made me want to switch to a coverlet instead of a down comforter with duvet cover. It's been hard to find what I really need.
0,1594K Planer,"I have several bosch tools and I am normally a fan or their products, but this planer was likely one of the worst purchases I've made in a long time. Like many other reviews have already stated, the front and back sleds of this planer do not lay parallel to one another and there is no method for adjusting the angle. I've tried adjusting the blade to align with each plane, but it still seems to cut with a slight angle. Can't seem to find a use for mis-aligned cuts. Needless to say, this planer is going back."
1,Another Leo Lionni masterpiece,"When I was an elementary school teacher, Leo Lionni was my favorite authors to study. Of his vast works, Tillie and the Wall ranks up there for me. Lionni tells the story of a mouse's quest to venture beyond a wall that she has known all her life. His language is sophisticated (not watered down for young readers) and his collage artwork gives a feel of real movement and emotion, yet the story is simple enough for little ones to appreciate.I highly recommend this book and other Leo Lionni titles. Almost all of Leo Lionni's children's books deal with conflicts that kids can relate to (trying hard, being different, loneliness, fear, teasing) and they carry messages about individuality, dreaming big, or helping others."
0,One cannot possibly make a decision so poor as buying these,"I have never felt as disconcerted over something as trivial as a pair of headphones as I do now. It would take great efforts and extensive study to find a pair equally poor as these. The slightest of movements will remove them from your ear. If one were to cough then his ears would be as bare as when he was without earbuds. They do not remain put either when one is sitting, standing or walking. I beseech you not to purchase this pair, I would not have anybody, no matter their faults, to feel even a moments exasperation of this sort of which I have felt much too long."
1,Ditto on the Paladin RJ11-6 Way,"Just as with the Paladin RJ11-6 Way Adapter, it is manufactured with the same quality and rugardness. I highly reccommend this adapter. It should be in every voice and data technician's (bag of tricks) tool case/bag. Again, my only issue is the price. I think Paladin could find a way to bring down the cost in these tough economic times. We can all use a little help. Buy it, and use it in good health."
0,Ok. Good story line but it had a weak ending,"I liked the beginning but towards the end it just seems she could've made it a bit stronger, maybe even a bit different."
0,Sturmovik and Steam,Have tried for months to get an answer out of Steam why this software refused to load. Goggle it and you find thousands of people with the same problem. Steam does not have an answer. They will run you around in circles trying this and that but the fact is they created a monster and can't even figure it out themselves. I HIGHLY recommend you not buy this game or any game that runs through Steam.
0,Why is it one sided?,"The thing that gets to me the most is that Shalit believes that a return to modesty by women will correct all these wrongs in today's society. It is not a return to modesty she really desires, but a re-instatement of virtue. This cannot happen simply by wrapping women up in unrevealing clothes, but instead requires the education of MEN and the changing of MALE ideals. Too much concentration on what is wrong with women ignores the more important factor of the other sex. Miss Shalit also does not have the worldly experience to have a grounded opinion. Regardless of her young age, she appears to have never challenged her own views. If she had, she may have been able to make a more convincing and well rounded argument. As it is, she is simply regurgitating information she has gathered that explicitly supports her purpose."
0,Lightweight Adaptation of What Seems to a Lightweight Story,"David McCallum of ""The Man from U.N.C.L.E."" fame could not save this story no matter how many voices and accents he tried. The people are uninteresting. I cared not whether they lived or died. The plot twists were pretty much out of the ""Very Big Book of Spy Story Elements"" reference. I've heard it all before, and it wasn't really worth listening to the first time in other stories"

1,Fantastic Compilation Of Greatest Hits,"This is the best (so far) compilation of John Mellencamp's Greatest Hits ever released. This 2CD set collects all of his most important songs and popular works. If you're a John Mellencamp fan you should not be without this great collection. This set is far better than the single disc titled ""The Best That I could Do"" which was release a few years ago. That one has a lot of great songs missing and with ""Words and Music"" you get the very best of John Mellencamp. There are no misses on this one, only great songs from a great singer and songwriter whose music has lasted for many years. Mellencamp is a poet at heart who has always had a good song up his sleeve. Get this one you will not be disappointed. Is definately a keeper."
1,Love this classic,"I remember watching this when it first came out back in '94 on vhs. While I still have the tape, the VCR was put away awhile ago and I wanted a digital copy of the movie. I was hoping it was downloadable so I could place it on my media server, but at least I can watch it with my family through my xBox with the Amazon Instant Video Player. This is a must have movie for the Christmas season, right up there with National Lampoon's Christmas Vacation, Scrooged, and others."
1,Great summer read!,"This book was recommeneded by a co-worker. I loved it. It was light, funny and easy ready. I would totally recommend this book to anyone!"
1,One of my favorites!,"Wow! I love this DVD. The cardio section is pretty lame, I'm not going to lie, but the rest of it is really good. They work muscles that other DVDs don't and the first time I did it I was so sore! To make up for the short cardio I try to do 20 minutes of something else, but even if I don't I still feel like I got a good workout.I really like the variety. There are two workouts, one for dresses that highlight the upper body and one for dresses that draw attention to the lower body, otherwise you can create a workout doing the sections you feel like doing. I normally do all the sections for a total body workout. This DVD never bores me, and I keep reaching for it everytime I go to work out. This is one of the best purchases I have made."
1,"Well Researched, Comprehensive Biography","Tad Szulc has done his homework writing the biography. It provides an excellent insight into the zeitgeist and formative experiences that gave the world Pope John Paul II.If the book has two faults, they are:1. Lack of concerted effort to be critically objective, occasionally leans towards obsequiousness. Fortunately, it doesn't mar the content;2. Very technical writing style - exacting, but doesn't make for fluid reading. This has its benefits in terms of a very good index, bibliography and notes."

0,Still waiting for the game,"Not sure if we like this game or not as we ordered on on November 19th, and as of today, December 23rd it has not shipped. This has happened to me before with pre-ordered stuff so I would be really cautious if you want something for a gift when you order from Amazon. In reading the other reviews it looks like this has happened to other people. Better buy it at the store, so you can be sure you get it when you need it. I thought over a month was plenty of time to receive it, but I guess I was wrong."
1,Way too short...,"...but your imagination will fill in the rest. A compelling story about a 19th century gentleman who travels forward in time to the year 802,701, and encounters a world transformed. Vivid descriptive text and a suspenseful story line, interspersed with the narrator's political and social interpretations of what has become of mankind, make this novel a journey for the reader as well. Don't wait for the upcoming movie...read this book!"
1,Scientifically true and hilarious!!,"This book answers some of these questions that you really wanted to know the answer to, but were afraid to ask somebody. 'Can A Guy Get Pregnant?' answers oddball question on the Body, Love, Death and Animals through scientific reasearch with a good dose of humor. Questions range from 'Do Dogs watch TV?' to ""Could A Black Hole Kill Us All?'. You'll have to read the book to find out. I smell a sequel, folks!"
1,"Super Easy Install, Great Design","The title says it all. Install is super easy. Make sure the cord is unplugged form the wall, pull the tabs out, cut the wire, put each side of the wire into the dimmer, make sure the polarity lines up and push down the tabs. 2 minutes to install. Couldn't ask for more."
0,DISHONESTY IS NOT THE BEST POLICY,"WHEN I ORDERED OSCAL-D FROM AMAZON SITE AND SOLD BY CANDY COSMETIC DEPO, THE EXPIRATION DATE SHOWN WAS AUGUST 2013. I DID RECEIVE THE ORDER ON TIME AND THE INVOICE ALSO SAID EXPIRES AUGUST 2013 BUT THE BOTTLES SAID THAT THEY EXPIRE IN FEBRUARY 2013. THAT IS WHAT I CALL CHEATING. NOT GIVING ME WHAT I ORDERED AND SUBSTITUTING WITH ITEM THAT EXPIRES SIX MONTH EARLY. THEY EXPECT ME TO TAKE 240 PILLS IN ABOUT 100 DAYS. AT ONE A DAY IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AND ATLEAST HALF MY ORDER IS GOING INTHE GARBAGE. IS THAT FAIR????"
0,"After two duds, customer service told me to get another unit!","I received the DS-1 from Amazon, and it DIDN'T WORK FRESH FROM THE BOX! A second (replacement) unit worked for less than two weeks. When I called Fellowes customer service, they said this unit was notorious for having issues with its sensor and that I shouldn't bother getting another...and then offered to ""upgrade"" me to a unit that costs half the price at Amazon.Also, take note: When I called Fellowes customer service, they were (I thought) helpful and sent a replacement...however, at the time I asked them whether I should just go through Amazon, and they discouraged me from doing so...yet now, when I'm stuck with a SECOND useless machine (just over Amazon's 30 days for return), they want me to pay shipping to return the unit in order to get my money back.Moral of the story: Don't get the DS-1. And if you have a problem (which you will), go through Amazon."
0,Too much hype,"I hated this book. It made me feel dirty reading it. The author was such a scumbag for the first 23 years of his life, and he expects to atone for everything by telling us over and over in the book how he knows he is an addict, and criminal, as if this explains why he was such a creep to everyone in his life? Yuck!"
0,Some interesting characters but way too slow,"I'm sorry to say but I just couldn't get through this book. Read about half of it, but I'm not into long meandering descriptions. If you want a plot that will carry you along, this is not the book."
1,Kudos Koontz!,"What a great book! This was my first book by Koontz and after reading this I must read more. I couldn't put it down. I just wish that something different happened to the ""bad guy"". That's the only reason I gave it 4 instead of 5 stars."
0,1 star only because of picture quality,"I've received this DVD for Christmas almost 2 years ago and I was so disappointed with the picture quality. Mine is all dark and the details of the costumes and furniture doesn't show.Before, I kept rending the DVD from Netflix and their disks were so nice (it wasn't the special edition though but the regular DVD which they have stoped selling by now). So I was used to seeing the nice detials, colors.Today, I've broke down and purchased a used copy of this older-version DVD from Amazon marketplace. I hope and pray that copy will have a nice picture quality because the movie is 5 stars otherwise and have watched it countless times!Good luck with your copy."

1,"Better than Alien3, and better than the critics say","Ripley's back, cloned to create alien-human hybrid offspring by (that familiar trope) recklessly overreaching scientists, in the Alien series's conclusive fourth installment. I don't count the Alien-versus-Predator travesties. Director Jeunet brings his regular players Dominique Pinon and Ron Perlman for just the right mix of quirkiness to go along with the doomsday bleakness. Sigourney Weaver conveys the darker note of a woman who's come back from torment and death.Conventional wisdom says Alien films declined in quality by installment, but I disagree. Resurrection is clearer and more engaging than Three by a wide margin, and better than the naysayers say."
0,"Great for a few months, then worthless","Agree with others (see abovee). Terrific idea. Works great for a while, then the rods get bent and it becomes more or less worthless."
0,A total reinvetion of the legend,"Where to start with what is wrong...The costumes and weapons are not the correct period, Jesus has fair skin and blue eyes. Joan has black hair not blond, the accents are all over Europe and not correct for the English or French except the few times a real Frenchmen is cast, and because of research done by French historians such as Roger Caratini, Its clear today that Joan's influce in battle was less leading the charge and more along for the ride.Lets not talk about the acting, but rather the over acting. I wouldn't go after every actor but Mila J goes from wimpering idiot straight to wild eyed loon at the drop of a hat.The real Joan of Arc was zealot that heard voices yet was charismatic enough to rally the French at a critical time and was sold out to the English when her usefulness to crazy ratio dipped too low. This movie portrays her as a raving loon that got what was coming to her."
0,not crazy about these,The sound is good but the fit is very funky. I cannot figure out the twist to fit system. There is no illustartion in the package or at the Sennheiser website. I passed these around my office and asked a bunch of tech geeks if they could figure out how to fit them properly into my ears and no one could. My ears are pretty average looking too. Also - the cord is about 7 feet long. This is absurd! I have had to gerry-rig it up with twist ties so it doesn't hang down between my feet and trip me when I am running.Also - that green color is super ugly.
1,Santa boots,The boots are perfect for my husband who plays Santa every year forseveral Lions events...
1,BEST BUY FOR 8 to TEENS!,"This is really the best hoop available for youngsters to teens. The hoop adjusts from 5 feet to 6.5 feet, which is perfect for probably K-9. I bought this for my 8 year old granddaughter, and she loves getting outside now to shoot some hoops! My 14 year old grandson is 5'2"" and it is a good challenge for him at the 6-6.5 height. Good value for the money. The back of the backboard is lightweight plastic though, so be careful not to tighten the screws too tight and be gentle when laying it on its side because it will crack."
0,So much fun - at first!,"We loved our Roomba and had so much fun with it for the first three weeks. We even named it - ""Roy"" - and talked to it in baby-talk we loved it so much.

Here you go little fella.""After three weeks our battery died and with it ""Roy"".The manufacturers were NO HELP AT ALL!!! Poor Roy sits here, dead in the corner and the people who sold him to us will not help us. We are out BIG BUCKS.Don't go there people. It isn't worth it!!!!!"

0,"Can't replace ""Manhunter""","I'm pleased to see that other reviewers have had the same impression I had. Red Dragon is just a remake of Manhunter, and not nearly as good. All the performances in Manhunter are much more intense and edgy. CSI's William Peterson is a better Graham, Tom Noonan a MUCH better Dolarhyde, and Brian Cox will always be THE Hannibal for me. My two stars are for Harvey Keitel, always an interesting actor, even if his character wasn't."
0,The Replacements Supposed Soundtrack,"The Replacements is a great feel good movie filled with laughs and a few good lessons. The music in the movie was great and added to the enjoyment of watching it so of course I was eager for the soundtrack. What a disappointment!! It uses the term ""soundtrack"" in the loosest possible way. Classic songs, the ones that would make you recall a scene from the movie, are all but missing. The only song that is a legitimate soundtrack item is ""I Will Survive"". The rest is wasted space. It is not worth the price!!! Buyer beware......."

0,Koran for real dummies who can't think,"For the first time since buying a book on-line I was tempted to wrap it up and send it back, this book was that terrible. It went out of its way to avoid any negativity or criticism about the Koran or about Moslems, whether mainstream or fanatical. This is a very sanitized version of this holy book, and unobjective to the extreme. I was searching for true meanings of the Koran elements but reading this version was a complete waste of time."
0,Not a masterpiece,"when you are a child, you need communication. Words are a key ingredient to a childs growth. This record doesn't portrait the real heartfelt disney i know, and grew up with. I would not recomend this compact disc to any other people. Overall, I would say this record needs work, it doesnt show the real disney that the movie shows. Don't let me influence you, buy it, and find out for yourself."
1,The Gobi Desert,Classic early travel tale of Gobi Desert published in 1944. Clean transaction. Would do it again. Thank you.
1,Amazing,"This is hands down my favorite film of all time. It's one of those thriller that doesn't need to use tons of blood and gore to make you cringe, the dialogue is so well written that you're glued to the story without having to see all that torture porn. Great psychological thriller. Please watch this movie!"
1,Watch it over and over again and each time laugh until your sides ache!,"This is my favorite of all of Sandler's movies. It is among one of the few movies that I cannot count how many times I've seen. I could never grow tired of watching this movie! If you like movies that are just plain FUNNY you'll love this movie. Kathy Bates did an excellent Mama. There are a few lines that will stick with you, and if you are like me years later will still laugh hard every time you hear them. ""You can do it!"" is my favorite. Sandler's character is simple, sweet, and lovable. Mama is more multi-dimensional than I expected her to be the first time I watched the movie. His girlfriend would seem like the worst match on Earth for him, but they make a great comedy compliment to each other well. The coach is another lovable character. You'll be rooting for the good guys and laughing like you haven't laughed in years (or since the last time you watched Waterboy)."

Imagine my disappointment to discover the text to speech had been disabled on this book by the author/publisher.I would really appreciate it if they would reconsider turning on this function. Thank you for a chance to express my disappointment. I will know to look for this in the book details BEFORE I make my next purchase.This is the big letdown I have with my new Kindle Fire.

1,Amazing,"If you haven't had the chance to hear Arrau's performances of Chopin's works, buy this disc. You will truly be hooked. Unlike many people who believe that Ashkenzy or Rubenstein are the ultimate Chopin interpreters, I must say that Arrau rivals and tops them. His flexible and slower style of playing matches the romanticism of Chopin's works. Coupled with a great conductor and orchestra, this brings out a top-notch performance.These discs are well worth the small investment."
0,Wish I had read the reviews prior to investing!,"Not a quality product. Seems uncomfortable and unsafe. Also, not good for a baby over 1-2 months old, because most likely, by then the baby is too big, both in weight and in length. Safety strap is very small and can hardly be adjusted. When bouncer is in upright position, baby flops over to one side. This review is based on an average sized 3-month old. Prior to this age, our daughter didn't care for it. Like I said in the title, I wish I had done more reading before investing in this product."
0,"Zero, zero, zero star!","I think it is our, Amazon members',communal responsibility in Amazon to warn other hapless horror aficionados to steer away from this stinking pile of disaster. You miserably watch pitiful actors for one hour only to see almost all of them torn to pieces back to back in five or six minutes, which is actually a relief.The bear is simply the star of the movie and is believable and horrifying; other than that avoid AT ALL COSTS.I very much regret for the wasted 91 minutes of my life."

1,Outstanding music and remixing,"Not only is this the definitive box set of the definitive 20th century blues man, but it's exceeedingly well mastered. Every facet of the guitar sound comes through clear as crystal. This is a must have for any blues or rock aficionado."
1,High Sierra Charcoal,"Its appearance is quite unique. It is perfect for a school bag.All the school material fits, and shoulders don't pain.The only negative aspect would be the time when it involves ""clicking"" the switch because its sometimes hard to open it.!"

0,"The Edwin Hopkins translation of Gorky's ""The Lower Depths""","This is a warning. This is an atrocious translation and should be avoided. Hopkins, who translated this work in 1906 is either sloppy or just a poor translator. The English is awkward, and what is most reprehensible, Hopkins just plain omits two of the most important factual items of the entire play--1) Gone is Pepel's admission that he spend time in prison because he murdered a man, and 2) and this is the most grievous of all, the fact that Actor hanged himself at the play's cnclusion (almost the last words of the play which produces an immense impoact) is also omitted. There is no good reason other than monetary since all copywrite is probably gone for this edition, to republish it. I learned this the hard way, using it in a class amd now have subjected my students to this particular translation. It is a wonderful play, but this edition should be taken off the market."

0,"Suddard must have ""won"" AI like Bush was ""elected"" president","There's no other way to explain it. Based on sheer talent and effort, Kim Locke deserved to win, with Clay as the runner-up.At its best, Studdard's voice is appallingly mediocre, at its worse, painfully flat and strained. His best performance was his initial audition for the show - it's been all downhill from there, including this dismal album. The songs on Aiken's album may have been bad, but at least Clay can sing...a misguided but undeniably talented Christina to Ruben's inexplicable and atrocious Britney.If you loved Ruben during the show, you might like the album, and probably have it already. Good for you. Different strokes and all that. But otherwise...yuck."
0,"Why the midquels, disney??? Why???","First off, the animation was very nice. But pretty is as pretty does, right? The story is pretty weak and fairly uninteresting, like most disney DTVs today. It's about Tarzan's boyhood. Like I said, it's not too bad, but it's not very original either.This is one of disney's first so called ""midquels"" that later spawned nightmares Bambi 2 and Fox and the Hound 2. I know that some don't feel that way (especially about Bambi 2 apparently), but, if you ever ask those that do like them, the answer is usually that they would have preferred a real sequel. What's with that, eh? Anyway, I'd rent this, there is too much of a chance that you might not like it."
1,"Totally Awesome , Totally Exciting , Totally...Totally Carnage!!","You may not be the sort to give such an unheard of game a try but to simply overlook this game if you're into say Blast Corps is an amazingly stupid move. Not only is this game the pinnacle of totally awesome, it is one of the toughest games you could play for the SNES. Blasting , Explosions, and utter mayhem in this game make Michael Bay look like a footnote.Pro-Totally Awesome-2 player Co-op-Many Many Weapons-interesting Scenarios and Bosses truly are very inventive-Something to play if you've played Blast Corps or Smash TVCons-It was only released on the SNES-Really Really Tough so if you're one of those casuals its not for you"

0,Smells like mothballs,"I bought this stand to keep our bikes upright in the guest bedroom. Stand is solid (though kind of a pain to put together), but otherwise great. A few days after we got it in there, we noticed a weird smell in the bedroom. Turned out it was the rubber feet of the stand. They have a very strong motor oil and mothball odor to them. I took them off, washed them, and let them air out. After a month outside they still smell horrible. Now, the stand slides around when I put the bikes in, but it's too big of a PITA to send it back."
0,(oh-so-slightly) Endearing and (pseudo-exploitative ) Cute,"2 1/2These once ""in the hip"" Japanese female goofy rockers have not aged so well, as I am sure they did not even sound all that well when they first emerged and became all the rage for a brief time. Perhaps the sad lack of cultural connection to different music forced ""open minded"" music listeners to dig this, but the overtly exploitive and gimmicky nature of these tunes, not to mention their dumbrock songwriting style, would have any hardened musical cynic laugh at the mere premise. Still, some of these foolish little odes to the little things in life carry enough kinetic weight and vocal intuition to remain slightly endearing, switching from it's extreme light-heartedness into (rarely accomplished but often attempted) unabashed child stomping glee"
1,Good product but maps aren't up to date,"I like the features on this unite and it seems pretty easy to use. The only real problem for me is that many locations are not up to date. The strip mall down the street opened over 2 years ago and only around half the locations are in the Garmin. I did an update of their software and none of the locations missing came up. I realize there is some turnaround in getting this stuff mapped, but 2+ years should be enough time especially given that around half the businesses are there. They all opened pretty close to the same time. Pretty annoying to think that if I search for a restaurant while traveling that it might not show if it opened in the past 2+ years?"
1,The best studio album,"Okay, everyone bought this in 1975 for Bohemian Rhapsody. That, in and of itself, makes this album a great buy. If you don't know a lot about Queen, you might be in for a bit of a suprise by the whole album. Queen always dabbled in experimentation with music and vocals. They basically covered everything from rock to country to disco. Casual fans would want to get Classic Queen and Queen's Greatest Hits. The true fans always have this one ready to go."
0,Crime and Punishment,This is one book that I would not recommend to anyone. The author had so many character and so much detail that I could not even get past page 55. All the characters in the book seem to have nothing to do with each other and it got to the point that I did not even want to try to read the book anymore.
1,Hi-Tec & Geriatrics,"Have worn Hi-Tec boots forever & they last almost as long. I wear out the sole before I wear out the boot. Use them for walking, hiking, & most of all, for my hillside gardening. Cannot wear clogs or tenny-runners on the hill as there can be alot of slipping & sliding on loamy gravel. Have never had a seam fall apart. Extra pair of boot strings would be nice."

Do yourself or another a favor and purchase this GAME u will not REGRET it even if u dislike SNOWBOARDING this game is UNBELIEVEBLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,Enjoyable,"I enjoyed this book. Although the projects are not for everyday practical items, being a creative sort rather than a practical sort, I found Simple Knits with a Twist encouraged thinking beyond the norm and also promoted recycling of items, such as plastic bags, and leftover yarn. It was helpful to me becaue although I love knitting and crocheting, I don't necessarily enjoy making the same ""type"" of items all the time, its just enjoyable to make something that is interesting, rather than practical. I agree with other reviews though in that the patterns don't go into great depth, so you will require some knitting know-how to be able to complete the projects. Otherwise it is a very attractive book and nice to flick through the pages."
0,The entire book is fiction,"The content within this book has been proven untrue, this is not about Obama's family or his life. The girlfriend in the book doesn't even exist, the story having to do with the theater and they argument he said they had never happened. The magazine he claimed to have seen about the black man dyeing his skin out of shame was not true and the article doesn't even exist. From beginning to end the book is not about his life or his family, it is a collection of fairy tales and should not be taken seriously."
1,Black & Decker Brew 'N Go,Delivery was speedy. This was a gift for my husband who had the Brew 'N Go with the cup that did not fit the cup holder in his vehicle. He loves that this one does fit the cup holder but commented that it was easier to pour water into the other one.
0,Waste of money,"This is the 2nd and last Denise Austin dvd that I've bought. I gave her the benefit of the doubt after buying the boot camp one and thought maybe she'd do better with this one since it's a different style...but it was just as horrible. Her voice and how she uses it is aggravating, she's clumsy and doesn't instruct well, you have no idea what she's doing next. I didn't make it through the whole thing, not because I couldn't phsyically, but mentally I just couldn't tolerate her anymore. It wasn't energizing like a dance video should be. Any time I dance I feel energized to keep dancing, but with this I just felt annoyed by her. I think all the positive reviews are written by her staff or the other dancers on the dvd or family members."
0,A good idea that fell short,"I was really hoping for lots of great info when I ordered this book, but it wasn't there. LLL really needs to update this and include the specifics that moms need to nurse a preemie. This is not a book but a pamphlet. When it came in I devoured it in a short amount of time and couldn't believe that that was ""all there was"". I really expected more of a LLL publication and was very disappointed, however, the info it did have was good and accurate, there just wasn't enough of it."
1,AWESOME!!!! REAL TALENT!,"Ive been a Hil fan forever and honestly she can sing and were slowly forgetting about pop music people! Think about it , R&B; and rap music is being pushed on us constantly , but we need to have pop forever!Hilary is such a great pop artist ! Not to say other artists arent but we neeeeeed pop music! And this is a great collection of the songs plus the new ones and only her fans really get the purpose of a collection album. Thats because shes been sooooooo successful all over the world and has a huuuuuuuge fan base of 7 year olds to 70 year olds. Who else has that and who do we want our kids and teens looking up?? Anyone as awesome as Hil u can think of? Not really. Unless Paris Hilton counts as a role model............This is a really great fun album to dance to and sing to and its a fans perfect collection!! CANT WAIT FOR THE NEW ALBUM NEXT YEAR HIL!"

1,Minus one star for Amazon not stating risk of bad eggs!,"Really, this is still an awesome deal, and it was no surprise that there was a small catch. You should just know about it before you buy. You are sure to get one or more broken glasses in the delivery and I got one in three boxes so far. I do not know if this is a packaging failure or that they are known by Amazon to contain broken glasses before shipping. There were also two glasses with serious imperfections from poor quality control issues. But still at $2.50 a glass i am not complaining too much, just doing a service by printing my experiences. They are very good glasses overall if not broken or defective!"
0,Directv R15 Defective Product,"I bought a Model R15 Recorder and it started turning itself off and I could not get it to turn back on. I hit the reset, reinserted the card and it still did not work. I unplugged the beast and left it unplugged for 15 seconds (hard reset) without any result. Directv replaced the unit and I have had a brand new one for about four weeks now. The new unit is now starting to turn itself off. This time, doing a hard restart worked but the unit is obviously verging on failure. Directv said they could do a hard drive replacement over the phone but I would lose everything I had recorded. That is like buying a new computer and having to constantly do a restore wiping out your hard drive. This product needs to be taken off the market."
1,Haynes Manuals,"I always have to have the reference manuals. I'd perfer more detail on some issues and less 'general repair aimed a the novice'. However the Haynes Manuals are a must for any car owner (do it yourself or have the work done, so you can reference what is being stated as the problem)."
1,Muy buena por Paulina!,"First off, Paulina is not, by any means, the world's greatest vocalist. Like J.Lo, she is somewhat thin voiced but still loaded with musicality. One can tell that she's not totally comfortable singing in English yet, as the lyrics sound a bit forced. The Spanish tracks, however, flow much better. Despite these flaws, this disc is still fun, full of energy, and dance floor ready. Paulina does not write any of her own music on this album, which doesn't help her. Writing her own music could help her find her own voice and sense of style. 'Border Girl' and 'Don't Say Goodbye' are my fave tracks. They're easy and fun to listen to say the least! Some critics are picking on Paulina because the lyrics are light weight and, what they call, 'Fluffy.' I say, 'Who cares!' If every singer was like Alanis Morissette and Melissa Etheridge, with their deeply personal and meaningful lyrics, the world would simply go nuts! Paulina's music is light, fun and relaxing. ENJOY!"
1,Feeling Better!,"The booklet was helpful in knowing the right foods to eat for my blood type. I have not been following it to the nail, but broadly I have been. I can say that I am feeling better, with a more energy then when starting. Have not lost any weight yet :-("
1,Leprechaun,"it was great to watch again, I remember watching it years ago and it's still as great as ever. I would recommend it to anyone to buy."
1,3D Little Prince!,"For anyone loving this timeless allegorical story, this version brings it to the eye in more tangible ways. It was wonderful to anticipate what would pop up when I turned the page and there they were -- the unforgettable words, albeit in English, and lessons about life and caring and loving. This version is also a terrific introduction of the story for young readers who will not yet understand the depth of expression meant by the author, but will perhaps, enjoy getting lost in the fantasy of a ""little prince"" from another planet. In short, I loved it!"
0,Great novel; poor edition,"This is just a warning about this specific edition, published by Wilder Publishing. I purchased this edition over others that were slightly more expensive but ended up regretting it. It is rife with spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors. The errors were so egregious it didn't appear to have been proofread at all. I loved the novel, but the experience would have been vastly better had I chosen a book by a reputable publisher."
0,Mastered doesn't mean better,"The movie is the same as the 1986 production; however, the mastered version has altered many of the sounds as well as the script. To put this in perspective, take your favorite movie and blank out the best ""one-liners"" and you have this mastered version.I'd love to know where I can get an un-mastered version of this classic. I have sent this one back to Amazon and they have credited my money back."
0,disappointed,The print AND bible are so small I struggled to read it. The so-called leatherlike cover is only colored paper. I was VERY disappointed.
1,Halo Does it again!,"WOW! A few months was worth the wait!Even though im kind of getting bored of it because it is my only game for my 360. Ive played Halo and Halo 2. Pros and Cons:Cons:-Forge Money Buget, i dont like that, beacuse we should have unlimited things and infinate money(Without Glitching).-Multiplayer Energy sword, since they put a limited charge, it will change online gameplay with it.Pros:Good storyline, great graphics, more optioins when creating your own Custom Game."
0,Changed size makes this speaker useless.,"The speaker this one replaced, the PIONEER TS-MR165 has a completely different diameter. This is a boat speaker and pioneer might have thought about keeping the dimensions the same. Generaly when you replace something like a speaker, you'd expect it to fit exactly, but the idiots at the new CHINESE plant didnt figure that out. The amazon store where these were purchased shipped them out quickly and I have no complaints against them whatsoever."
1,"So far, so good","This blender is very powerful. It is also quite heavy and feels like it has quality manufacturing and finishing. It pulverizes ice in about 2 seconds flat, and has no problem blending even when completely full. The only problem is that the pour spout is almost non-existent, so depending on the consistency of what you blended, pouring can be tricky (particularly with thick frozen drinks). Great deal for the price."
1,So much louder than my others,"I have three sets of lightweight headphones and when I use the other two on my MP3 player I have to turn the volume up way higher to hear the music than I do with these Phillips headphones. I wish I knew why that was because whatever feature it is I'd like to know so I can look for it in other headphones. My wires have begun to break, right at the thick reinforced part above the plug. I've wrapped electrical tape around the broken area and also lashed the cord to the belt clip of the player to keep the wire in a set position. But I know this arrangement will not last long so am looking to replace. I must say, in spite of the weak wires, these headphones have served me well for over two years. I am a small person and all headphones are a bit too big for me even on the tightest position but the rubbery headband helps because it clings to the top of my baseball cap and stays put."
0,SpaceBalls....,"I've been playing this game for a good amount of time. I was having a great deal of fun until the dreaded CU. Now the only thing worth playing is JTL. So if your going to spend your cash, i'd spend it on a sweet copy of Spaceballs. Cuz atleast you can laugh your ass off instead of crying, then laughing, then crying some more. SOE has driven SWG into the ground..."

1,Worth keeping,"I was required to use this book for a counseling course and had planned to sell it ( as I do with most text books) when the couse was over. However, I found the book to be well organized and easy to read. The best part about the book are the living into the lesson exercises at the end of each chapter. If the reader will take the time to do these exercises he/she will get even more out of the book. I will keep this book as a reference guide of practical suggestions while doing therapy."
0,Get what you pay for,"Great price, but the chargers don't function as well as the OEM one. When the phone gets fully charged it starts to beep saying that it is charger and continues to do this until it is removed from the charger. With the factory charger it would just show that it was fully charged on the screen and no annoying noise. Mainly a problem when we put the phone on the charger before bed and wake up at 2AM to the phone's soft, persistent beeping."
0,Not as good as other books,As a total beginner at Genealogy I was looking for a book packed with beginner type info. I purchased this book and the book for dummies. The book for dummies was much better. It gives you lots of web sites to move your search along. This book is very limited and if not for the dummy book I may have just quit.
0,so so - too bad,"The chapters alternate between math and historywith history being the stronger of the two. In termsof mathematics, the author creates difficulties forhimself immediately by introducing the RH via the zetacomplex zeroes instead of the simpler and more naturalversion via prime numbers. Much harder to explain,however, is the absence of the dramatic and importantwork of Levinson [showing that the RH is at least""one third true""]. The book was completed in a hurry(it shows) and would have benefited from better editing."
0,Self-deflates in less than 48 hours,"This was rated the ""Best Inflatable Bed"" by Hammacher Schlemmer. Inflating the mattress was easy, but replacing the heavy gauge power cord into its slim compartment took almost as long as it did to inflate the bed. I inflated and slept on this mattress for the first time on Sunday night, then slept on it again Monday night. I woke up this morning (Tuesday), still in the middle of the mattress, with my butt on the floor! I guess this COULD be a good mattress if you didn't have to inflate it every other night. I'm returning it for a refund.I forgot to mention that I was unable to inflate this mattress enough to make it feel ""firm"". It reaches a certain point, then just STOPS inflating. If you look at the photo without the people on the mattress, you'll notice it looks ""saggy"" in the middle. Well, that's an accurate photo because that's as firm as it gets!"
1,"Can't get enough of ""El Capo""",This is far the best series of its kind. I'm on the second part and want it to keep going!
0,Juvinile,The 'plot' is weak and one dimensional so don't expect intrigue and sophistication. If you find sexual inuendo and bad language entertaining then you may enjoy this movie. I'm no prude and can cuss up a storm with the best (or worst) but I find the use of four letter words in a public display distastful. The sexy part was quite amusing; it was the language that made me squirm. The movie didn't need it and it would have been 10 times better without the anglo-saxon expletives.
1,A Splice is a Nice Splice,"Not a real technical piece of equipment, but it is 3"" on both sides, the hose fit easliy over each end and the wire clamps fit snuggly, putting it all together.Using the splice allowed for use of the entire hose, especially since I cut the ten foot section into exact lengths for the different equipment and branches on the DC system."
0,Not for anyone with real angst,"Catcher in the Rye is the most overrated book I have ever read (and I have read many). Holden Caulfield is 100% unoriginal and phony and symbolizes the concept known as the ""White Man's Burden"". Holden is the origin of all of his 'suffering'. He also symbolizes the hypocrisy of priviledged people (perhaps Salinger's intent). I give this book 2 stars for the simple fact that it could fool so many people for so many years. If you are interested in reading this book because it is 'the voice of your generation', then think again. Anyone, especially teenagers, who are suffering from actual anguish and emotional pain shouldn't waste your time reading this book because it will only annoy you."
1,Oak Bar Stools,"These are great, easy to put together, good and sturdy. The only thing wrong with them is they are about 2 inches too tall but from reading other reviews I knew that before I bought them, otherwise they look great and are very comfy."
1,Provides clear video images due to excellent insulation from electronic interference,"Excellent product!Provides much better insulation from electronic interference than other cables I've used. The benefit is clear, noise-free video images.Works perfectly with my ThinkPad's S-video input and output plugs.I like the ease with which you can separate the audio wires from the video wires, because those inputs are on opposite sides of my laptop.Finally, for me the length is just right -- anything shorter would be too short to reach conveniently from my laptop to my home entertainment center."

0,Stay far away,"This is by far the worst Paul Rudd or Steve Carrell movie made to date. Someone thought it would be fun to combine the awkwardness of The Office with the darkside of Wes Anderson. Both attempts were dull at best. Save some time and money, skip this one."
1,Good Book!,"This book was good. I read it in one day, actually very similar to something that happened in real life. I enjoyed it and would recommend it, it's worth the money!"
1,when the west was fun,This was a very good dvd. It was fun to see the old western stars all together again. It showed highlights of the best westerns on TV. It would be nice if they would bring back westerns on TV.

0,"MISSING PARTS, SELLER WON'T RETURN CALLS/EMAILS","I am very disappointed in this product. There were missing parts to make this unit unuseable and I immediately contacted the seller and they did not contact me back. I purchased this as a gift and I make a lot of purchases on Amazon and this is my first bad experience. Amazon is now telling me that I can't get a refund through them because their refund only covers:1) When the buyer provided payment to the seller, but the seller failed to deliver the item.2) When the buyer received the item, but the item was materially different than as depicted in the seller's description.I am very disappointed in the way this matter was handled. If only the seller would've called / emailed so I could tell them what missing parts so I could use this but they aren't responding to any requests.I would highly recommend buying a different smoker."
1,Good album....Land of the Free part 2?,"This album reminds me of another Land of the Free. Some excellent songs, some good songs and some I could live without. I wish the guitar had more edge to it...It seems a little soft. And too much strumming, not enough palm mutting. Otherwise, a good disc."

0,More Questions Than Answers,"This 2pack set had a nice price when I first noticed it. But there was no information about the version and who is appearing in the movies. Very difficult to buy without proper information.Now the price has gone up so I guess I won't be getting it.Does anyone have details on this item? Tried to search the title on-line, but couldn't find it anywhere else.More questions than answers for this listing."
0,"Unoriginal, Uninspiring, Annoying","What people don't seem to understand, is the Evanescence are NOT the ""breath of fresh air"" everybody thinks they are. They are a label-generated band, with label-generated music, that blatantly rip-off Lacuna Coil (who are one of the best and most talented bands in the world). Amy Lee's vocals are pitch-corrected, which is very obvious to anyone with basic knowledge of recording, and she sings from her throat, which makes everything sound nasaly. It's just annoying. Let's face it, Amy Lee is a 'goth' version of Britney Spears, and is only slightly more talented as a vocalist. If you want to hear real music, written by real musicians, with the most amazing frontwoman ever, listen to Lacuna Coil."
1,"Complete, sturdy, and looks good","It only took about 4-5 days to start working the blade into smooth one-handed use. As usual with Victorinox, the blades are sharp and the fit it tight so no complaints there. As everyone is saying, it's a little big for your pants pocket, but I keep mine in the inside chest pocket of my coat without a problem. Lastly, given the size of this knife, the lanyard ring is basically useless unless you have the key to a city.Final note: Although not shown in the picture above, this model does include a wood saw"
0,Be aware!!!,"This unit is by far THE WORST coffeemaker I've ever seen. I used to grind beans before brewing and use fine grinding. When you fill this unit with water and put two teaspoons of ground coffee, then press Start button, it instantly clogs the filter, overfills the basket and your cup stays empty, but coffeemaker is all covered with ground coffee. I tried to remove their filter and put cone filter #2 instead, same results. Coffee is everywhere except your mug. I used at least ten coffeemakers, but this is THE WORST."
0,"Disappointing, Disturbing, and Age-Inappropriate","A) This book had virtually nothing to do with Ember.B) It focuses on the religious fanaticism of a woman who leads her town in an obsession with cleansing the world of sinners.C) At one point, it lists examples of ""sinners"": ...""'Lindabell Trufoot, sluttish.' And Morton Wilsnap, queer'"", language I find completely inappropriate for a book that is advertised as being written for 9-12 year olds."
0,"Another ""extreme plasticiry"" scam!","Once again the science of the brain is being spinned and twisted in order for some one to make money out of it. I watched this entire thing on PBS. It's the same old trick, taking bits of scientific facts about how the brain works and completly infering all the wrong conclusions. ""plasticity"" (the ability of the brain to learn) is nothing new! Anybody who can remember what they had for lunch can understand this since that expericence had to leave some phyiscial trace in the brain in order to remember it. Explaining the phyiscal process behind this ability to learn, and then pretend like this is all some new scientific discoveries about how the brain is mallable in any shape or form is extremly deceiving and quite sleazy. My advice is to stay away from this dogma based nonsense.. save your money!"
0,Redeeming?,"From the title Buffalo Soldiers, I thought there would be some brave individuals, independent perhaps for the army but none the less brave. Instead, I found no characters with integrity, a sense of responsibility or even a smidgen of patriotism. I slogged on, expecting change but it never came with the book ending, the print anyway with no real resolution. The writing , descriptions and action was fine but without characters or a plot, this was very forgettable."
0,Very disappointing compared to the first AoW,"Age of Wonders I was certainly one of my all-time favorite games. Highly customizable hero with fantasy creatures under your control in a beautiful fantasy realms. It had high replay value and kept my interest for many months.This sequel did not live up to my expectations. The leader customization revolved primarily around magic spheres, as compared to specific abilities, which was possibly the coolest feature in the original game. The magic sphere customization system was not reminiscent to the first game, and definitely not as fun.This may be worth getting if you're just looking for another fantasy RPG/Strategy game, but if you're looking for a sequel, you will be very disappointed."

0,In soccer You don't score 8-0,No matter what level of difficulty I put it on the game is way to easy. All you have to do is take a shot from the slightest angle and then the goalie will fly way left or right of the ball. It automatically goes in. NO FUN.
0,Be careful - not for young children,"I rented this movie from the library last night, based on the description on the cover. My daughter (almost 4) started crying when the mouse ate the pig, and was bawling by the time the owl ate the mouse; we turned it off. She woke up screaming in the middle of the night last night, but would not say why. I should have done my research, had no idea this could be sad for little ones."
0,Not great,"I have two of these head sets. One never keeps its charge, pretty much from the time I bought it. The other seems to charge alright. the ear piece is cheap and feels like it could break off anytime.The sound quality on my end is good but my friends have complained about a slight buzzing sound and ask me to switch to a wired mic.Also it's big and heavy compared to the motorola I own. I highly recomend the motorola. (sorry i dont know the model number off hand)"
0,Can't get the money OUT!,"I bought this bank for my 3 year old daughter. She loves it--it's everything all the reviewers said, cute, durable, etc...BUT! It's VERY VERY VERY HARD to get the coins back out the bottom. There's a ""lip"" of rubber all around the edge of the opening that makes it nearly impossible to get your finger in and scoop out coins. Plus, the pig's legs are hollow. When you shake the bank to get all the coins to the bottom so you can get them out, most of them fall into the legs. It's very frustrating for her, and even I have a hard time when she asks me to fish out her money for her."
0,Dragon Lover,"Ordered this ring as a gift after reading the other reviews. Received the ring very quickly, and when I opened it - I thought it can't be the same ring. VERY disappointed with the details. I couldn't tell what the dragon was. I regret buying it."
0,Don't Buy This Kit if you Have the Canon SD990 IS Camera!,"This Canon case may be great for certain Canon models (it's nicely made)- but the SD990 IS fits so tight there's no way Canon intended this case to fit that specific model. And shame on Amazon and Canon for advertising that the two items work together.As for the long metal-with-plastic neckstrap - it looks like something out of vending machine at a bowling alley - you know, the ones with the mechanical arm that searches thru the junk pile to pick out your your 50 cent ""prize"" and dump it down the chute.At least the battery was the real deal and works fine. That's the only reason I'm not returning this kit; not worth the hassle since the battery goes for $41 and this 3-piece Combo Delight was $49.As for the case and the neckstrap...where did I put that can of lighter fluid?"
1,Worked Great,Just got back from a trip from Ohio to Florida. It rained most of the way down and part of the way back. I went ahead and put our luggage in garbage bags just in case but we did not get any water inside. The bag strapped on quite easily and I would recommend taping the straps down to eliminate wind noise. All in all a great product and I had not problems using it.
0,A BIG LET DOWN,NOT MUCH 2 SAY THE BEST PARTS OF THE ENTIRE FILM ARE THE BEARDED GUY AND HIS GIRLFRIEND THERE ACTING IS BETTER THEN THE ENTIRE MOVIE DONT BUY IT RENT IT FOR A BUCK AT YOUR NEAREST RED BOX OUTSIDE MCDONALDS ALTHOUGHT YOUL BE DISAPOINTED THAT U SPENT THAT MUCH MONY ON GAS ON SUCH A WAST OF TIME!
0,Disappointing,"Although I can hear some interesting aspects to this, it pales to insignificance when I listen back to his '70's innovations. the excellent 'Floating Music'- Island Records (1972) with his Close to the Edge band,and the follow up'Freedom is Frightening' with his band 'East Wind' - Island Records (1973) It's a shame these aren't available on CD presently; but if they ever are, be sure to snap them up."
0,Do NOT spend your money!,"I read the entire Left Behind series and ejoyed it very much. It was fast moving & very interesting. This book, on the other hand, was extremely slow and boring. I purchased it on CD. The unabridged recorded book containes 9 CD but half way into disc 4 I quit. In addition to the VERY slow story, the reader is dull and lifeless. If you completed the Left Behind series consider the last book THE END. Don't spend your money on The Rising."
0,Missleading,"I find the title of this CD completely missleading. I was expecting a GUIDE to the orchestra being a complete ignorant, but there is no guidance at all. I was expecting Benjamin Britten to comment the instruments that were playing but there is nothing like that. All you hear is beautifull music."
0,Caprica can't stand on its own.,"Battlestar Galactica is one of the best shows ever. Caprica however falls short. The only thing that kept me watching is the fact its apart of the Galactica universe and that it might answer a few questions the show didn't.Pro's+Acting is great.+Does provide some insight into the Galactica universe.+Pretty good cliffhanger.Con's-Some parts are as boring as watching paint dry.-Holographic internet glasses... don't remember those from battlestar..-No action at all.-Alot of O.C. like drama.When this show airs I will watch it, mostly cause Battlestar is over and, Lost only has one more season."
1,"Finally, A visual outlook on Fibromyalgia!","When I first saw this I was so emotionally overwhelmed in such a postive way though! There were tears,laughter, and relief cause I felt like ""YES"" a film on this and people with it saying almost everything I go through and want to say as well to people who are not ""aware"" at all, or just ""don't"" want to be aware or educated about Fibromyalgia.What I liked best was the variety of ages,genders and races of people that interviewed and shown that have fibromyalgia to break the stereo type that only women over 40 get fibro, and the visual aspect of the symptoms of fibro. The realistic and positive outlook on living with it and showing people laying down on the bed and couch because their just so fatigued or in so much pain, it's all they can do. At the same time showing how strong in mind and their positive attitudes it shows that in spite of having fibromyalgia were survivors!!I would recommend this to a friend and family members, etc."
1,A beautiful picture of life and death,"This is definitely Burroughs's most powerful book since Naked Lunch, and perhaps my favorite after that. It's a wonderful journey through the lands of the dead, and offers a few clues into Burroughs' personal beliefs on the subject and how he feels death should be approached and life to be lived. Definitely read the first two novels in the trilogy first, though. Burroughs' books have always been less about narrative and more about painting a picture. This is a beautiful picture."
1,Let Go Let Miracles Happen: The Art of Spiritual Surrender,"Kathy Cordova's book ""Let Go Let Miracles Happen: The Art of Spiritual Surrender"" is like a coffee table book for the heart. The concepts she writes about, letting go and spiritual surrender, are beautifully presented, simple to understand and show the reader how letting go is not only possible, but life changing. This is a book you 'gift' to those in your life ... there are golden nuggets in there for everyone! Kathy's book provides the path for making journey of life more sacred, meaningful and provides tools to help one go with the flow!"
1,Best school memories book I've ever seen!,I love this book!! The pages are big enough to hold all your treasures from school and the pages are written out beautifully! I really wish this book would have been around when my 14 year old son started school. This is terrific for my 5 year old daughter!
1,Great in so many ways!,"This is one of the most diverse and beautiful albums I've heard this year. I am a big fan of Africa Bamba (with the Toure Kunde riff here, for people who know Toure Kunde), Smooth is very nice and I have never heard Rob Thomas sound any better, and Maria Maria is one heck of a song with a catchy hook and, as usual on EVERY song, great gituar by Carlos. This cd is worth the effort. But for a few songs like The Calling and Wishing It Was, who gave me no excitement or inspiring feelings like the others, there is no better album this year, so far."
0,Terrible,I too have had a terrible experience with this stapler. I've always used it with the Arrow T50 staples yet at best I get one good staple out of every 4 tries. It jams often and is just a total waste of time and money.
0,Chingy...,"!Heather's Teenage Son!...what a stupid single you've come up with. Wow. Look how much I care about how rich you are. That just proves how full of himself this guy really is. I dunno, maybe the full-length album is better but I highly doubt that. STAY WAY AWAY FROM THIS TRASH."
0,Wrong item sent,"I received 40w not 75w. I'll keep them, because I can use them--very unAmazon. Don't understand why this happened. Did not discover until opened."
1,Works Well,"Works well--right size for a shower, fits well in the hand, and moves water like it's supposed to. My only complaint (and this may be a user problem!) is that it loses its grip in the rounded corners of my shower. I have to use a second hand to hold it into the corner. Well worth the price. As a bonus, the suction holder has stayed attached to my shower wall for two weeks and counting."
1,A great gadget for technophiles,"I bought one a couple of weeks ago, and I love it. The documentation is practically useless, so learning to use the Cyberpad was pretty much trial and error. Once I figured it out, though, I was delighted."
1,Still continues to keep me wanting more,"Since most of this dvd has been explained in another review I'll just give a couple of my thoughts on it. First, I'll have to agree with a previous reviewer in saying that Rahxephon is one of the best series to date. Since the first volume this series continually impresses me with its strong character development and engaging story. Volume six of this series does a great job of realistically showing the emotions of Ayato and the people around him, especially those of Nanomori and Megumi. This series continues to impress me and its definitely something I recommend you viewing."
0,Half and Half,"This book really did it. It put me to sleep so fast. The reason why I gave it 2 stars was because the first few chapters did give a quite good introduction on cryptography. I don't know how I got fool into buying this book. Oh yes, it was because of the 5-stars rating I saw on others' comments."
1,Excellent Condition,This book arrived in excellent condition as described. I couldn't have asked for a better deal. Thanks!
0,The worst blow dryer in the world,"I usually do not believe negative reviews if there are many, many, many more positive reviews. However, I wish I had with this blowdryer. I almost never review items and when I do, they are positive. But this is a first. This is the worst product Ive ordered on Amazon. A COMPLETE WASTE OF MONEY. Literally the worst blowdryer. Isn't it a travelling blowdryer? I took it to south america, a week after I'd bought it, and it overheated and shut off. Needed to wait to cool off. Now its been maybe 2 months? And it literally does not dry for more than 5 minutes because it over heats.HORRIBLE blow dryer. Seriously, do not waste your money. It is the worst I've ever seen. Get one at the pharmacy for $5 more and you will be better off.Now I need to get a new blowdryer....thanks...."
1,Thanks for another great product!,Here is another great product from the folks at Baby Hands Productions!I have a nephew Luke that has learned many of the signs from My Baby Can Talk - First Signs. (My wife watches him 5 days a week.) He loved to watch it every day but seemed to be loosing interest in it lately bacause he had learned most of the signs.This new title My Baby Can Talk - Sharing Signs is just what we needed! He is eagerly watching and learning the new signs. It is such a joy to watch the frustration disappear from his face when he realizes that he is able to communicate with us!
1,great cleanser,"No other cleanser shall touch my face! i have acne prone , blemish prone skin -- i feel that this cleanser is the best i have used.also, i had given the seller a 2 or 3 star rating as my product didnt arrive -- when i reported it to them, they responded promptly and mailed another one overnignt. i give the seller 5 stars for their customer service and follow up"
0,Just Dont,"It was cheap. The materials were flimsy and it doesn't turn well. I was disappointed, because it was way over-priced for the value. I was too embarrassed to give it as a gift and bought a much nicer set at WalMart for less than 1/2 the price."
1,The Superior Book For Linux Security,"The Best Book I Have Read In A Long Time. Not Only Up-To-Date But Covers Every Topic Extremely Well, A Great Book For Anybody Considering To Set up A Linux Server. Outlines The Basic To Advanced Procedures To Set Up A Linux Server. Money Well Spent, A Must Have For Any User Wanting To Expand Their Knowledge On Linux Security."
0,"Spong is, as always, wrong.","Christianity bad, irreligion good. That's all you need to know about this drivel. His viewpoints are trite, full of empty platitudes. His writing style is amatuership, reflecting very little in the way of true intelligence. A book likes this makes you wish you were illiterate."
1,saves my nails!,"I use this to remove staples from bulletin boards, and occasionally to separate packets. I love it! Great for teachers."
1,"Not Perfect, But Thought Provoking",A book that honestly and fairly tries to show how an view of the universe as millions of years old actually does not contradict anything except the doctrinal tradition of modern Christianity. The main part I had problems understanding was how the author could say evolution wasn't real after having supported the case for an earth that was millions of years old.
0,Sexy and Provocative Psychological Thriller..... No point at All.,"This was sexy and provocative psychological thriller, but it also had no point in it what so ever. She was crazy and depressed and needed help. And who was the little girl at the end. And what was the cause and effect in this movie. Yes there's nudity, hers only, and sexual acts. You really don't hear anything but see the visiuals. I'm still trying to figure what was the point into making a movie like this and what happened in her past that we don't see at all.. And yes she did help others see what was missing in thier lifes. The movie itself just plain stupid, and trying to feel sorry for her isn't the answer either. But my favorite part was the end were her best friend punches the sh---out of her."
0,Where's the Music?,"This 'musical' contains a dearth of great songs - ""Jubilation T. Cornpone"" being as good as they get. And I do mean 'dearth'."
1,Trigo,"The big Trig, trigonometry remember the word, remember the course in high school. After reading this book I am a fan of trigonometry and circles and squares."
0,Very Disappointing,"The book was a big disappointment.Highly hyped and recommended.The story fizzled quickly and the characters were duds.If I could say anything about the book, it would be that some really neat ideas were ruined by uncompelling writing."
0,Bad on all levels,This movie is bad on all levels.Acting - DCasting - DDialog - EStory - ECharacters - ECG - E (Computer graphics are great when you can't tell that it is CG)
1,"Typical political messages, but more juvinile",I read this book twice in my life.This book was typical in the Heinlein political and social messages. It was fairly two dimensional. It is certainly not Heinlein's best work. It is a short story that lasted a bit too long. But it is a classic for its kind.
1,I AGREE WITH THE MAJORITY,"hey, i am on the bandwagon with everyone else. this is essential early DITC. FAT POCKETS inspired FATBACKS by quasimoto. SOUL CLAP.........NOLIA CLAP..........hmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. love the title cut as well as the first song STILL DIGGIN'. everything else here has a very nice flow to it as well. shoot, the whole darn album has a nice flow to it. it did not get the props it deserved though. wasn't BOUNCE TA THIS on this one as well? if so, then hey, another song i love from this classic that time forgot."
0,Beware- It's Trouble,"I bought a ""Refurbished"" unit from U-Bid at a great price (I thought). It was $65 plus $20 shipping. Unfortunately the DVD recorder only worked one day so now I have an $85 VHS which is not a good price. After playing a couple of movies I started recording my first DVD. It hung up the recorder while trying to finish the recording. Had to unplug the unit after about an hour. Now it won't recognize any DVD, even movies I had played previously. Get an ""unknown disk"" message. It has a 90 day warranty and I'm waiting to hear from U-Bid to see what my options are. Don't be fooled by a low price, this unit is not worth two cents!"
1,LOVE this show! Want the entire series on DVD!,"This is a most wonderful series for all ages. It appeals to adults as well as teens. My sons and I watched every episode and we miss the series but we watch the Season One DVD together. We hope they release the remainder of the seasons soon. Anyway....If you haven't seen this series, it is great. It deals with real life problems and has real life characters. Not one character is ""perfect"" and they all deal with their flaws as best as possible or remain in denial. There were so many issues I could personally connect to. This was a great series that got cancelled way WAY too soon. Guess we will just have to view the 3 seasons over and over and over again....Once and Again. Sigh...Once and Again...we miss you like an old friend taken from us in your prime!"
1,Best Book Available on solving freshman chemistry problems,I have been teaching chemistry for 34 yrs and this is the best book for explaining how to do freshman chemistry problems that I have ever used. It gives excellent worked out examples of many different types of problems in freshman general chemistry. it is a great resource for students or teachers of general chemistry. The author M J Sienko was a great lecturer and writer and a master at explaining how to do general chemistry problems. I highly recommend it for both students and teachers of general chemistry problems.
1,AMAZING MIC,"One word. (AMAZING!)The quality of this mic it's outstanding. I love it, and I already done two great commentary gameplay videos with it. 5/5 If I could rate it a 10 out of 10 without a doubt I would. Great buy! Looking for an amazing mic for 70 bucks? what are you waiting for? Blue Microphone/Snowball is your answer."
1,Head and shoulders better than the first,"Now this is what I'm talking about. This album should have been the first release. PMD makes a big come back with his second solo effort. The beats are way better than the first and the lyrics sounds like lyrics from a classic EPMD album. The album is grimy, dope pure hip hop. With dope appearances by the Hit squad, this album is a must have for all EPMD fans."
0,"OK, not great","OK, first of all, judging by the some of the losers who do not know how to spell or use proper grammar that have reviewed this movie, I guess I should expect THEY would like it, so let me offer an intelligent opinion.This movie had a lot of funny scenes, but a lot were downright crude and disgusting too. The topless scenes and most of the biological function scenes were totally unnecessary. I think some of the funniest parts were bringing in references to some of the classic 80's teen movies which most of the audience (who were under the age of 20) really did not get. My friend and I (teenagers of the late 80's/early 90's) seemed to be the only ones in the theater who GOT all those jokes. I think the movie was OK, but only for the few, selective good laughs. Wait for this one to get to the dollar movie!"
0,Gald we aren't the only ones,"We received this as a gift last Christmas and thought it was us that kept over cooking or cooking things to fast. Misery loves company, it's good to know we aren't the only ones unhappy with the high heat. Last week on Thanksgiving we put the mashed potatoes in the pot and even on the lowest setting they were boiling."
1,"Different, but still Tracy","More pop, subdued, introspective and brighter; this album is very different and unexpected, but there are melodic moments in a few songs that allude to previous work and remind me that this is definitely Tracy. After a few listens I am catching the tunes pleasantly running through my head, so I suppose I can honestly say I`m hooked."
0,JLS S-M8 XM8 Spring Airsoft Rifle Tan,"JLS S-M8 XM8 Spring Airsoft Rifle TanThis ""toy"" broke within 5 days of receiving it. I mean completely fell apart, while my 13 year old grandson was trying to shoot the thing! Waste of money!! Now I am fighting to get my money back, because with Christmas and all, my daughter had to re-buy a similar item for him!!!"
0,"Not 34"" long, actually 32"" long","I need a changing pad cover that's 34"" long, and in the description online it says 34"". However, when I received it in the mail, the package says 32"". That won't work for my changing pad, so I'm returning it."
0,Awful!,"I am a dragonball fan. I have watched most every episode of dragonball, dragonball z and dragonbal gt.This live action movie is really pretty awful, but it does actually follow the script of the movie on the Dragonball - the Saga of Goku boxed set. Strangely that movie retells the opening as a movie instead of as a series of episodes and is itself awful.In the episodes, goku is a true hero. He shines. He is fearless and caring right from the start. In the movie (both animated and this one) he is really no better than yamcha! Further, there is almost zero character development in the movie, so you honestly just don't care about any of them.I wouldn't let anyone I know watch either movie if I had any hope of them getting into the rest of this series."
0,Not what I expected,"I see that my review is not like the others. I didn't like this book. This was the first book that I have read by Donald Goines and I don't care for his writting style. Some parts of the book was elementry.I do like the so-called ""ghetto luv"" books, but this one did not grab me."
0,Wrong book and bad return policy....,"I have made purchases with my own credit card and with the card of my mother. I have always been satisfied. NOT this time. This particular purchase was the incorrect book. Whether it was my ordering error or their sending error, it makes no difference. I mailed the item back to Amazon.com (LLC) not once, but twice and they sent it back. Plain and simple I do not need this book so now I am stuck with a book I will never use.James Cardon"
0,Wrong Description and Vendor Still Has NOTCorrected!,"This is quite an attractive watch...for a woman. Vendor has wrong description and still hasn't corrected it a month after my purchase. Vendor didn't respond to ANY e-mail requests. Took over 2 weeks to receive. When it arrived it was not a Men's watch. After numerous e-mails for help I called and left a message. No return call. When I did reach a person, Sara, she was very helpful and issued an RA number and return UPS label. They had had the watch for over a week and still hadn't credited my account. Called back again and they did it while I was on the line. I would not work with this vendor again. Prices are similar to local store prices so it was a ""deal"" anyway."
1,Pure,"A co-worker brought me a cassette version of this gorgeous LP after she returned to India for her sisters wedding. All I knew of Indian music at that point was the brilliance of Ravi Shankar and the tinny sound of movie soundtracks.Don't get me wrong, I love Shankar. This is another avenue, and in some ways a more peaceful one, into Indian classic music. Shankar seems (to my poorly trained American ear) more structured, more cosmopolitan; Call of The Valley has a more agrarian feel to it.On a side note, I find it endlessly amusing that the closing track on the cassette, Rag Pahadi, is based on a three-tone motif identical to the cheesy 1950s-American single ""Baby Face."""
1,Buy it!,I played this during a large Oktoberfest party. It was a huge hit. The scenery is absolutely beautiful.
0,this sucks,dont buy this piece of junk for that much money because it will break if you hook even one 3 pound bag! i give it 1 star because atleast i was able to save 1 out of 2 hooks just so i could hook my son's diaper bag!
0,this was the worst cd,"OMG i am so mad i spent my hard earned money on this horrible cd. It is NOT EVEN MUSIC! it is horrible! Their new song on the radio (boriqua, borena, dominicano, clumbiano) ITS NOT EVEN ON THE CD! and the beat for move your body was Pitbull's beat for his song culo! THese girls are nothin but fake! Dont get this cd. Every song is soo horrible and they cant sing, and they jipped me out of 16 bux! I am trying to sell this cd on e bay now!!!! OMG i am so mad!"
1,"better the the ""old"" one","I looked for any make I could buy but Waterpic seems to have a lock on the market so I bought one and so far, it is doing a good job. It is smaller and works better than the old model I had (which lasted over 8 years)."
0,Cannot Rate This Book,"I have an English version of this book which is fantastic. Because I know people who doesn't speak English, I ordered two (2) of the Spanish versions. Unfortunately, I never received my book. Seller never sent me a tracking number. After more than 20 days waiting for the book, I contacted the seller and got a full refund. I'm giving this book only 1 star, because I didn't get the chance to actually review the Spanish contents and compared them to the English version for accuracy."
1,How Did We Get Here?!,"I so enjoyed reading this book - not only was it educational and fascinating, almost like a detective story of how we got from the years when computers were just entering our consciousness, through the birth of the internet years to our world now, filled with games, CGI, movies with fantastical effects, smart phones, tablets and who knows what next.The creativity of the minds behind the innovations that led to and make our day-to-day world, the nets and connections of those individuals, is well laid out and inspiring. Whether you are young and curious, interested in movies or the worlds of Lucas, Coppola, Pixar and more - or just a history of the refinement and evolution of ""personal"" computers, I believe you will enjoy and learn from this book as I did. For me, it filled in all the gaps of what was going on behind the scenes in computers from when I graduated college in 1975.Just loved it!"
0,Not the original cover,"This record came in a plain black sleeve, not the original cover. While the sound is good that aspect is disappointing."
0,I hate this book,"I read this book on the recommendation that it was the finest English language novel ever written. Well, I can assure you, it is long and boring and I could care less if Katherine and Heathcliffe get together in the end anyway, if they are dead. It's pretentious and long winded and just awful. I must give Miss Bronte credit for writing a long love story that holds its continuity until the end and doesn't take you on ridiculous tangents and sub plots. But the main plot is boring and it hurt me to read it all the way through."
0,Bad warranty policy,My collar stopped working after 3 months. Innotek doesn't honor their warranty unless you buy from an authorized dealer (which doesn't include Amazon).
0,VERY STUPID!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,I thought this movie would scare me! I expect to be scared when it's a freakin horror movie!!!!!! That makes me so mad! I mean you barely got to see IT! Like maybe five times and that's it! That's not a lot for a movie that's 3 hours and seven minutes long!! A total dissapointment.
0,Not for Kindle,"I agree, this does not work in Kindle and should not be presented as a Kindle book. Kindle needs to address the lack of support for Arabic fonts."
1,Beware of price gougers,"As of this date, sellers on this site are asking $200 and up for this collection. If you cannot wait for Amazon to restock, TCM has copies in stock for $99.99. Screw the price-gougers."
1,Quiet and Efficient,I've had this in operation for over a year with no problems. I also like that it is the lead compliant version. I use both the timer and the thermostat to control usage. I have a fairly long circuit of approximately 125 feet round trip (with no head). It feeds another 75 feet of pipe. I run this unit on the lowest setting and it provides nearly instant hot water. I did insulate the entire circuit with the foam insulator from Lowes. I did have a couple circuit design / sizing questions which the manufacturer was quite helpful on before the purchase.
1,A Second Glance At The First Time,"Initially released in 1970 as a 7-inch EP, this is the second of two recordings that capture the band in its first European performance.Friendly Galaxy Number 2 has a sweet mid-tempo, while electric bass player Alan Silva stars on Spontaneous Simplicity. The World of the Lightening strikes a cool beat that charges up the audience, but its the beautiful vocal expressions of June Tyson on a series of titled entitled Black Myth that is an electrifying highlight, with Sky being a shining musical conclusion to the collection.An oftentimes tough find, the CD shows the genius of Sun Ra in a new venue and leading an incredible artistic show in front of appreciative fans."
0,turns orange,"I would highly recommend that you dont spring for a supposedly sterling silver chain in the hopes that it will not ""turn"" like cheap stuff does. My 13 year old has been wearing this chain since october, and it is now turning brownish-orange. Id say its not nearly as pure as advertised because sterling doesnt change colors. It looks, for all intents, like plating is coming off. Steer clear, or just buy the plated if you want , and save the money for ""pure sterling"" if your considering buying this chain."
0,Buyers Beware!,"I purchased this item because of the great reviews, 900 MHz technology and 9 channels. I had originally purchased the more expensive Baby Call model with more channels and rechargeable battery and returned it for the cheaper version and found they are both terrible. Yes, the reception is great; however, the LOUD beeping noise and flashing lights in the middle of the night are unbearable. We used new batteries and have the monitor plugged in down the hall so it should not be going off at all hours of the night."
0,"Boring, nothing too special!","Very boring throughout the whole film, the ending was ok but nothing too special!"
1,"I prefer other fruit leathers for myself, but this is the best for little ones","The flavor is good. I don't prefer the texture which is soft rather than leathery. My older kids prefer Stretch Island, however, my 2 year old loves these. Other fruit leathers are hard for her to chew, but these are soft enough she could eat them easily."
0,It trashed my Smart Media Card,"I purchased this player last month (but not from ...(this website)) and it works just fine, I am giving it a one star because it formats the smartmedia cards so they are no longer usable in other smartmedia devices, such as camera, card readers, etc. Some MP3 player mfg have developed a utility to format the cards back to the original state but D-Link has not done this for their players and have no intention of doing so. I just want to let you know this before you trash a SmartMedia card like I did."
1,Most comfortable slippers ever,"I've bought slippers for years. It's hard to find the kind I like: high ankle coverage, soft insides, tough rubber soles/heels so they can be used outside, and feel both secure on your feet and comfortable while you wear them. These meet all those criteria. Can't speak to the ""long lasting"" issue because they're too new, but they look pretty sturdy, so I'm hopeful. Can't speak either to the ""always available"" issue either because they're so new, but this is a popular brand so I'm hopeful there also. I've been frustrated in the past when a pair of slippers wears out by being unable to find suitable replacements. I hope I'll never have that problem again!"

0,ANOTHER PIECE OF GARBAGE ON THE MARKET,THIS IS NOTHING BUT AN EXTREMELY CRAPPY PIECE OF USELESS PLASTIC. IT LITERALLY FALLS APART WITH ANY WEIGHT IN IT AT ALL.I'M REALLY SORRY I WASTED THE EXORBITANT AMOUNT I PAID FOR IT.GIVE ME THE 1957 CHEVY'S ANYDAY. BYE BYE QUALITY! I DON'T RECALL THE LAST TIME I RECIEVED ANYTHING I DIDN'T HAVE TO WORK ON RIGHT AFTER I BOUGHT IT TO MAKE IT WORK CORRECTLY.THIS BOX IS NOTHING BUT TOTAL CRAP!!!!!
1,Can't beat it!,"I researched steam irons on Consumer Reports before buying (because I was tired of irons that didn't heat up or didn't steam well). This was top rated, and was cheaper than many other lower-rated irons with big names. I love it! It has an abundance of steam which is easily controlled. It beeps when it has reached the appropriate temperature (heating or cooling). It slides and glides very easily on the clothing, and the self-clean is very easy to use. It doesn't spit all over the clothes like my old iron did (which was also a Black and Decker, just a little cheaper model). I sew a fair bit, and it has been wonderful for pressing the seams, etc., whether using it steam or dry settings.We've had it a few months now and we have no complaints at all--I just wonder why it took me so long to go ahead and buy it! Definitely a good value for the price!**UPDATE 1/12/10**Would still highly recommend this iron and are using it exclusively years after purchasing it. No sign of it slowing down!"
0,This is NOT from Bernard Sumner,"There is a group called Bad Lieutenant (no ""S"") that is comprised of Bernard Sumner, formally of New Order. This is NOT that group...buyer beware."
1,A Good Book,I think this book is good and sad too. I like it because it has fighting characters. The main character goes to war. He writes a journal about the war. His dad wanted him to write the journal. I would recommend this book because it has action.
0,Boring.,"Felicity Learns a Lesson was boring. Felicity is the worst american girl. I recomend Josefina, Kirsten, Addy, Samantha and Molly more than Felicity. Felicity is just flat out boring."
0,Thought it would get better,"This was a book that came from my mom's library. I have started reading a lot of her old books. I kept thinking this book would get interesting, but it never really did. For the timeframe that it was written, it would probably have been considered risque. Based on reading this book I would not read another of this author's stories."
1,Great war memoir,"I haven't read this book for many years (and I no longer have a copy) but I still recall it as a vivid, realistic and very well-written account of life as a combat soldier on the Eastern Front. While it is quite clear where the author's sympathies lie,there is little overt political content and certainly no anti-Semitism. I liked it far better than Sajer's Forgotten Soldier-which, in any case, many informed reviewers contend is largely or wholly fiction."
1,Thanks for the memories!,My brother and I have been trying to get this movie for years since we are the only people we know who saw it on tv for the brief time it aired. I couldn't have been more pleased while I was watching it. It's pretty no-frills but the packaging and case were fine. Not that I was expecting much as I just wanted to see the show again.
0,Incomplete material,"The spiral bound copy apparently comes in two volumes. This is not mentioned in the listing in Amazon.com. I received Volume I only in my order. Amazon.com is now looking into the problem, I hope."
1,Sure beats throwing away my Koss Headphones,I got these Koss headphones a few years back and used them when I worked out on my exercise bike. The headphones are pretty good but the foam on the ear parts wore away quickly. Was pleasantly surprised to find out that they sell replacement pads. These slip on easily and restore the comfort of my headphones. I’m glad that a manufacturer still sells a product like this rather than making you pick up a whole new set of headphones just because the cheap foam broke down.
0,it could have been better,There was one good scene at the very end where she was ripping up the town. Other than that it was terribbly boring and sleezy. I thought this was a great idea. Could the woman come out victorious for once without the male domineering?
1,Love it,This is a great movie for boys and girls. Even my husband doesn't mind watching this one with the kids. It is a must have for the home movie collection
1,"Sexy, Dangerous, Romantic - All of Gayle Wilson's Touches!","This book was wonderful! Sexy and Dangerous, Romance with adrenaline! Gayle Wilson never fails to entertain me with her prose! Recommend this book to anyone who loves fast paced, danger packed romances! The characters are as strong and as real as the danger they are in! Buy it today and you'll not be disappointed!"
0,Book Review,"The book gives the reader a general understanding of how Army Special Forces were used in Afghanistan and a general understanding of the politics in the region. However, it is not very detailed. Depictions of battles and operations are very skim. No detailed descriptions of how units were deployed or maneuvered on the field. Because everything in the book is so general, many of the vignettes become repetitive and boring. Not for the military historian or for military personnel. This book seems oriented more towards the general public."
1,Terrific Tripod,The best buy in the marketplace. It easily fits into my suitcase for travel...the level works nicely and very sturdy for as light as it is.
1,"""Weckl & Stretch breaking new ground...instructional DVD""","Audio and video doesn't get any better than this project from Stretch Records (Concord Records distributor), and thanks to Carl Fischer and Weckl...this one-of-a-kind 2-CD-Set is right on target...anyone thinking about taking up drums or is playing in a band, needs to pick ""THE ZONE"" up...Dave makes all of this look so easy, you'll be playing like him in no time.Techiques that take years to develope will experience a short-cut after witnessing this album...the entire package is a must have...and once again, thanks to the insight of Weckl, Fischer and Stretch Records this is just in time for the ""Holiday Season""!Total 2-CD-Set ~ Stretch/Concord SCD2-9037-2 ~ (2001)"

0,Jewelry case,"I would not recommend this jewelry case. I was quite disappointed that one of the compartments was very shallow.Very few pieces of jewelry could fit in the case....It did have a nice design, therefore I would give this product 2 stars."
0,Condition not what expected.,"The book was marked very good condition. It was full of writing and highlighting. The book on the outside was in good condition, but the inside was a mess."
1,It Rings my Bells......................Nice Doorbell.,"I live in an apartment building and the bell to my apartment was not working properly, so I bought this and It works just fine.The only downside to it is, that it has different melodies that you can choose which is fine for me, but the button to change the melodies is on the doorbell ringer on the outside, which means anyone on the outside who is ringing the bell can change the melody.But other than that. I like it."
0,Super Advice,"A quote from the book:""For enormous, inoperable tumors, say, 'I AM the Presence healing this tumor.' Repeat this Affirmation 933 times. This will do absolutely nothing to your tumor--but repeating words for hours on end will provide a slight distraction in the midst of your dying process."""
0,FIF,"After listening to the first few FIF albums you get a certain feel for what they are like, and this is nothing like that. Its really relaxed and they dont rock out as hard as they used to. I like track 7, but thats about it. Its too mellow to be FIF. I love FIF but I hate this cd."
0,"Get something else, even if it costs more.","We bought one of these in spring of 2006 when our son was about 5 mos old, and it worked great with no problems. About 18 mos later, however, the cord started to fail such that the monitor wouldn't come on unless we moved the cord around to some random ""magic spot."" (Move around as in, turn the part that goes into the back of the monitor.) One day last week, the cord finally just died, and we couldn't get the monitor to come back on at all. The next day, we bought a new one of the very same monitor, and it's AWFUL. The picture is fine, but we were up til 2:30 am the first night, trying to find a place where the monitor didn't make this horrible, repetitive, endless static noise. I finally ended up sleeping alone in our guest room because I couldn't take it anymore. We're returning it today, and I don't care if we have to spend $300 on something else, as long as it doesn't make that noise."
1,The Best Of The Best,"A great chonology of this Diva's work from the beginning of her career into the height of it. All the tracks are very clear and will bring you back to where you were when you first eard them.A must for any collection, enjoyable and pefectly recorded, buy this one today."
1,One word of warning...,I got this for my 3yo son for the holidays. He asked for it specifically. My one word of advise would be to remove the batteries so that the toy is silent. Otherwise it makes the MOST annoying 'revving' sounds constantly. It drove me completely nuts just having it in the cart at the store. It's perfect once it has been silenced!
1,Les Miserables...WOW,"I loved this concert! I thought it was fabulous! The voices, and even though it isn't the show that you would see if you saw it on Broadway...the songs are the same! Sung beautifully and with as much passion as if you were in that era! I recommend this to anyone who loves the songs from Les Miserables! Great job! Oh, by the way...if anyone is wondering if Nick Jonas can really sing....Can he ever!!! He did a wonderful job! Awesome!!"
1,Not just for chicks,"This was much better that I expected. Sure the story line is kind of predictable, but there are so many funny and cute ways that it's presented. Josh Duhamel is quite good in this which I didn't expect. And, Kristin Bell isn't overly loud and full of herself. The movie has kind of an old fashioned feel to it - not overly sexy, not overly comedic. I can't quite call it a chick flick because I found my husband laughing at many of the scenes and I didn't have to worry too much about my teen watching it - no one jumping in bed or f'ing every other word."
1,Excellent Music and Storyline,"The music and the storyline are excellent; however, the animation/puppets and scenery/imagery is a bit dark and may not appeal to some. Little ones may find it scarey. Parents, watch first, then determine if your child should view it. It may cause nightmares in the very young (5 and under). It is one of my favorites, along with ""Corpse Bride"" as I enjoy the story and sets far better than most of the entertainment today."
0,poorly remastered,have watched all the previous 9 series and this one cannot compare in production quality. will wait as well on season 11 until i hear that it's produced well.
1,Funny As Hell. One of the Funniest Live Shows Ever.,Pablo Francisco is funny as hell. Pure and simple. He's got way different material than most comedians today and he uses sound effects he produces himself to make things funny. He has your typical comedian jokes about porn. But then he'll begin to talk about the music they play in porn. And his impressions are great too. Like of the guy who narrates the movie commercials is just brilliant and then doing an impression of Arnold Schwarzenegger selling tacos on TV. Stuff like that. This guy is a step behind George Carlin in my oppinion. Absolutely hilarious. A++++
1,A Software Development Must Read,"Steve McConnell has done it again. Anyone who has read his1991 ""Code Complete"" will understand the quality level ofMcConnell's research and objective analysis. Theincredible reference section is enough to provide anyonewith a lifetime's worth of background reading. McConnellhas assembled a tome of how to properly run a softwaredevelopment operation. For every argument he makes, thereis data to support his assertions. McConnell also readilypoints out all of the 'classic mistakes' that softwareproject managers have made through the years, and thenexplains the better method.For anyone serious about becoming a professional softwareteam lead or project manager, this is an absolute mustread."
1,relatable,I am a 40 yr old adoptee. It was nice to read how other adoptees feel. I don't feel isolated. This book also is a little sad in reading to see how some children feel. Definitely a good book to purchase for a child or teen that has been adopted.
0,Bait and Switch?,"I ordered a copy of Mel Bartholomew's great book ""All New Square Foot Gardening"" and was shocked when I got it to find out that it was such poor quality. The copy I got was printed on coarse newsprint type paper; the book was smaller by an inch or more than the one I had looked at in the house of a friend; and all the photographs were in washed-out black and white rather than color as they should have been. I am not a happy customer!"
1,For any age,"What can i say about this book? it's incredibly beautiful. Not only is the story amazing, but Spark's style of writing is profound, poignant, timeless. I cried during this book. Sparks writes with such clarity that it's soo easy to see the scenery. I gave this book to my little sister and she loved it. It's for any age. I saw the movie after i read the book and was SOOO mad! The movie is beyond stupid. Please, get this book."
1,great workout -fast-fun-no equipment needed-easy to follow!,This is the best one I think. I did my first Tae Bo video on VHS and I have done most of the ones he's put out. It's fast- the moves are easy to pick up and it really gets your heart pumping. It's a great workout that is a good combo of high intensity then a tiny bit of slow so you can catch your breath. When I started it I had quit working out for a long time- I could only do 10mins but I quickly worked up to being able to finish the video. Also has a bonus clip of Billy talking about how he started out. Don't expect perfect cuing but it really gets the job done. I own a ton of workout dvd's and I always go back to this. It's so cheap just buy it and push play every day-you will see results if you stick with it you won't be sorry!
1,Beautiful pictures of gardens - no garden info,"A beautiful book with wonderful pictures and many great ideas. I would have liked more written descriptions about the type of plants used. After all, the title says ""Garden"" I purchased two books and gave one as a gift to a friend building a ranch house in Mexico. She loved it."
1,Yank Ape hooked on TISM,"I would never know about TISM if i didnt marry a Aussie...After hearing Ol'Man River(Machavelli & the four seasons)cd. I was hooked. (Wanker.com) is great in your face music and its got a beat thats nothing i can find in the states. Its a little tough for us Yanks to understand but all that I've made listen to it love it at first hear..the beat and the tunes you just cant stop singing...aka ""whatareya"" & ""yob"" and the second disk ""Aussie Guitar"" is great! hope to seem them soon..."
0,Fell apart within days.,After using the 5 mm wrench a few times it pulled apart. The ball allen stayed in the bolt and the socket end stayed on my wrench. Really sad for high priced tools.
1,Great unexpected twist on old theme,Powerful aliens who conquer the world are a sci-fi staple. This book turns the story around when the aliens have problems running the world. Comic cameos by John Kennedy and others.
1,"Very good, but has slow cpu","Good range out of the box, replaced the factory antennas with 6 dbi antennas and got even better range, but with p2p software the routers ""slows down"" a lot, when you start ares o similar the ping to the routers starts to go up tremendously, this didn't happened with wrt54gl."
1,Good read,The author once again kept the intensity up. bosch is the typical good cop you always want to root for .
0,black thermal underwear bottoms by Rothc,Although the price was very reasonable the product quality evidently suffered. The waist is way too low and the elastic is very weak. Might be more comfortable if worn over comfortable briefs. I was very unimpressed with this product and would not recommend it to anyone.
0,Very Helpful,"I can't say enough good things about this book. It has been so very helpful in dealing with and understanding by Dad's battle with Alzheimers. Everyone in my family has read this book and found help and understanding through it. Even if you don't have time to sit down and read the entire book, you can go to the section that covers the specific problem you are currently dealing with and get some insight into what might be helpful. It really gives you a great deal of insight into what people with memory loss go through and helps yo to realize that they aren't just trying to make you crazy (and you will have that moment)."
0,NOT the original version of the show - music edited,"If you are one of those idiots who says ""oh shut up and stop complaining, it's just the music, waaa waaa"", take your DVDs and BURN them. You know nothing about what it means for the music to be an important part of the show and are just a complete moron (I can't express in words the anger that goes through me reading someone go ""it's just the music""; it's NOT just the music!!!, it's the SHOW that is screwed up!!!)Quantum Leap is one of those shows where the music is crucial aspect of show; the music is not just some background noise; it sets the mood. The show is completely ruined and is not worth a cent without the original soundtrack. Awful job on the part of Universal."
0,Painful!,Hot bodies and gorgeous faces are not enough compensation for the stilted dialog and horrific acting. This film was painful to watch.
1,perhaps the best,"I am restoring a 1960 Old Town sailing canoe that needed a sail, rudder and lee boards. My source for specifications was on line pictures and I scaled the parts the best I could from pictures. Then I found Todd Bradshaw who made a sail and recommended his book. The book provided scaled plans for the parts I was making and discussed the science and reasoning behind his plans. This book is exactly what I needed. In addition Todd's book offered practical advice. For example based on his advice I contacted the Oregon State Marine Board and learned that I needed to ""title' and ""register"" my sailing canoe. If I had not done this and was cited, the fine would have been stiff."
1,A great looking controller,"The gold controller works just like any other N64 controller, but it certainly looks better. It is a nice addition to any gaming collection. This controller is somewhat hard to find and as a result will probably become a collector's item. I do recommend this controller if any become available."
0,Is this as good as it gets?,"Being very late to the DVD game, I wanted to be choosy about my first purchases. I wanted to repay the ""Buffy"" crew for years of great TV, and made Season One my first DVD(s).The show was broadcast on a grainy UHF station, and I thought I would be thrilled by the qualiity picture. Well, I was stunned alright.I now miss that grainy picture I was used to. At least the ""fuzz"" moves with the characters. On this DVD it just lingers there, distracting me, slightly, from the action.And the shadows are a little cartoonish looking.Unless I read very convincing reviews praising the picture quality of later seasons' DVD's, I'll wait a few years to buy any more of this series, when digital transfer technology has improved. I assume ""Angel"" DVD's will be similar.From now on, I'll only read professional reviews, like Sound & Vision magazine."
0,doesn't work,"I bought these pads when my daughter was just born, thinking that they were a great deal. I haven't tried the heavy flow pads, but the light and med flow didn't hardly hold anything. I had to change them every couple of hours. And you would think that because they are so thin they would be more discreet, well that isn't true either. They wrinkled and bunched up and my nursing bras, and could be seen not only under t-shirts, but under thicker shirts as well. I would suggest going with one of the brands that that are formed to your body. The Medela ones look good, but I haven't tried them. I like the Lansinoh pads. They are more expensive than the gerber, but sooooo worth it. They are formed to your body and are filled with something that turns into a kind of gel. One set will last the whole night, so they are much more absorbant. And they are pink, which for some reason is not as noticable under white T's."
1,Better than the DVD 405 by far,"The 505 is so easy to use. I like the special dual still shot and video capability (shooting a still photo while shooting video simultaneously). It is great to be able to take quality photos and video on one machine. The touch sensitive screen is nice too. The only hassle is having to switch DVD's during a longer session such as a class. But, Great job Sony!"
0,Not recommended!,"When I bought it about 4 years ago, I thought it would last a long time. However, the screen recently stopped showing any images and I could not take a picture any more. I took it to a camera shop and the guy there asked me if I dropped it. I did not. Be aware! While reading reviews, I was surprised to see that there was another person who had the same problem as I."
0,Un-readable,"I don't doubt that the rave reviews of this book are truthful, but I have to warn anyone thinking of purchasing it that the appeal of this book must be to a very thin segment of readers. My book club chose this book based upon the subject matter and the excellent reviews. However, not one of us could plow through to the end! And the person I gave it to afterward, who happens to be an avid reader, very intelligent woman AND an excellent Mediterranean cook... couldn't make it through this book either!"
0,"Wow, do they STINK","I cant get the smell out of my car. The first time we put them in it was hot so when we opened the door we about fell over. So I decided to air them out and wash them with some soap for a day. Ok, put them back in, still smell like burnt rubber, they work fine, how could they not? But the smell is overwhelming. I have washed them three times, still stink."
1,Heart to heart,"Excellent book. I was very moved by the story. It was chosen by my CASA (Court Appointed Special Advocates) book club, and it really help me to understand the unspoken struggles some kids goes thru."
0,Very poor quality!,"I have never seen so poor headphones. Honestly, it has a very cheap plastic; I mean the material it was made of. When I first time took it in my hands the first thought that came out of my mind was "" What did you spend a $100 bucks for, IDIOT!!!!!). Secondly, I didn't feel any difference with or without the digital processor (such a waste of money!!!). DO NOT BUY IT. I urge you to go to BESTBUY first and take a look at it ( my mistake, I did not do it)."
1,Grotesque Is an Understatement,"But if you want to really understand how and what happened to people in the 'advanced, cultured, sophisticated 20th century"", it's a good book to read. Appalling, but crucial read to understand how truly brutal the conditions were in Europe (not just at this one camp). Disturbing, but as such topics go--a 'good read'. We just can't let this happen again (and must stop what's happening now)."
0,Could not return.,"I ordered the wrong item. It looked exactly the same as the one I should have ordered (RBC24).I was able to slide the cartridge into my battery tray and all of the screws fit perfectly. But fail came when I tried to plug the power connector. It also looked almost exactly the same, except for a small notch on the connector making it incompatible. The specs for the batteries were slightly different. This one has 7AH per battery, when the RBC24 I should have ordered is 7.5AH.I could not use this battery unit with my UPS.I tried to return it but Amazon doesn't allow you to return batteries.My mistake on the part number, but they should allow you to return batteries."
1,Simply Majikal,"The closer that we approach to the witching hour the better this movie gets! This series has simply put a spell on my family and I! The characters, the story, and the special effects are not to be missed - and some of the suspense might even scare the younger wizards in your crew. There even is hidden, deleted footage at the end of the credits - lets just say that the window jenkins didnt become a widow on accident! Bubble Bubble Toil and Trouble eh?"
1,An Eye Opener,"Great investigative reports on various political, economic, and religious national and international topics.Names such as John F. Kennedy, Bush family, Pinochet of Chile, Pat Robertson of the 700 Club, Ken Lay of Enron, Putin, Clinton, Tony Blair, Margaret Thatcher and others are mentioned and discussed. This book tends to give more focus to the Republican's policies, but it also discusses the Democrat's mischievous ways.All in all, after reading this book I understand better why I don't support the dual party system that we have in the US (both parties are sell-outs to big money corporations and special interest lobbyists) and why I support third & fourth party independent candidates."
1,"Sure it's a fad, but why not....","A good film that is definately on the bandwagon with the horror revival but don't expect to be scared. I think anyone who remotely likes any of the Alien or Predator films can find some fun action filled sci-fi. It's also nice to see Lance Henriksen back on the big sceen in his ""home"" genre. In other words go see it, enjoy."
0,Good book for ideas - Bad recipes!,"I got this book after seeing the flavor ideas which were very inspired. However, I tried the first recipe (simple yellow cake) and the cupcakes were flat and chewy and didnt taste very good. They weren't awful but they sure weren't great either. That turned me off on the rest of the book since that recipe is in a lot of the other recipes. I didnt want to waste my time. I gave it 2 stars because of the inspiration behind it - otherwise it would have been a 1."
1,"Good for the price, but a little soft","I bought my first dSLR (Canon 20d) body only, so I had to find a good, inexpensive walk-around lens to go with it. I decided on the 28-70 mostly because of the 2.8 aperture at the wide end that seemed worth the extra $10 over the kit lens. While I do not have much to compare it with, the lens feels solid, the auto-focus is fast enough for me (it is a little loud, but I don't mind that) the range is good, and the lens does fairly well in low-light situations. I try to keep it at at least f/3.5 at the wide end, though, because the f/2.8 is pretty soft. I love the bokeh produced at f/4, 70mm also. Overall, I am happy with the lens, for $130 it's pretty great. ; )"
1,KID A = 5 stars,"This CD is only a 4-star album but it deserves a bonus star since it was such a balls-out move by radiohead to even release it. They could have made another The Bends or another OK Computer and became heros but instead they made an album to try and become legends. And for the record, it is a damn good album. Very dark, very gloomy, very radiohead."
0,Too Compact,"The ports are too close together to allow some USB connectors to be plugged into the hub side by side. The ports on the hub are about 5/8"" center to center. I bought this for multiple flash drives, but they require over 3/4"" spacing.Suggest you measure the plugs you are going to be using, including their shoulders, and verify none are wider than 5/8"". Might still work for you.Also might be better to buy something less compact or with the plugs parallel to each other and not so close, so you don't have to worry about which plugs will work and which won't."
1,slight damage in shipping but happy!,"This product is worth the money I paid, the only problem was that when I opened the box the edge of the fire pit and lid, looked like they had been dropped and bent slightly. This does not effect the working of the pit, just chipped the paint a little. The box did not seam to be damaged so I believe it was dropped at the factory while they were packaging it to ship, probably knowing that they damaged it but went ahead and shipped it anyway. This was made in China and they don't really care what they send to us Americans. I decided to keep it and not make a fuss since it still works perfectly and I don't need the hassle. It works great, and I am thinking about ordering another one for the lake."
0,Not so good,"I have used the D-Link DUB-H7 USB 7-port Hub for a little over a year. Previously I used their combination USB and Firewire for almost ten years without a single problem so I didn't hesitate to entrust D-Link for a full USB hub. 6 months in, one of the plastic widgets that held the USB plug in place fell out; without it, the plug hole is useless. A few weeks ago, another plastic widget fell out. Now I have only 5 usable holes (outlets). Now, lately I have to unplug the powered hub to get it restarted. Time for a new USB hub, but it won't be a D-Link."
0,Not for small Hail Dents,Had a couple of small Quarter size hail dents in my truck. Thought I would give it a try. Didn't have any effect after trying several times. The glue would break apart in the middle and stick to the puller and truck surface. May work for larger dents but did not help me.
0,Not Made in England,"I also purchased the Churchill China Brook Blue set of 8 (45 pieces) and the set of 4 (20 pieces) intending to have a matched set of 12. WRONG. The set of 8 was indeed made in England and contained soup bowls (listing on Amazon only says ""bowls""). The set is very nice and has high quality. The set of 4 and the completer set, however, are MADE IN COLOMBIA. The color is more saturated, the salad dishes are about 2 inches smaller than those made in England, the ""bowls"" are cereal bowls, and the vegetable bowl and platter are both smaller and less detailed than those made in England. Suggestion: if you want consistancy, order two sets of the 45 pieces and don't fool with the add-ons. Amazon could not guarantee the ancillary pieces would be from England.... despite the on-line description to that effect!"
1,Hope you're ready for the next episode...,"Truly a fantastic album. There is really nothing in the world that can really match chillin' in your room listening to ""Let's Get High"" while you're doing that very thing. No fan of hip-hop should be without this album."
1,Sweet book,"It is a sweet story about a woman who loses her husband, whom she is not really in love with. The story takes us on some twists and turns and ends on a happy note. I cannot wait to read the next novel."
0,A Waste of $30.00,"Once upon a time I would look to Rolling Stone for the best in popular music record reviews. No more! Now, much like the decline of the print magazine, the record guide also sucks much more than some of the albums reviewed. I guess I would rather listen to A-ha's second album than read this garbage. Notable for what it leaves out, including George Harrison, NIN, Metallica and Ry Cooder, among many others. But Justin Timberlake is included. Take your money, and buy a subscription to Paste Magazine and bookmark www.allmusicguide.com for your record reviews."
1,HATCHET,"Hatchet is definitely One of best I have read recently!! Gave it to my daughter to read, and she also loved it."
0,Does not work!!,"I have been waxing various parts of myself for 10 years, and this is the worst wax ever! I tried w/ the pre wash and oil, w/o the oil and just the pre wash, and w/o either and just soap and i literally counted the hairs it actually pulled out, under 10. I even stood in front of the AC unit to dry my skin out, and then applied and stood in front of it again to cool the wax, and it did nothing. Im going on vacation tomorrow and its too late to do anything other than shave. Im furious. THIS PRODUCT IS AWFUL!!!"
0,Exactly what I expected,Being able to purchase a 50# bag of dogfood from Amazon is worth it's weight in gold. Not having to lug it out of the store it great! The bag was in perfect condition when it got to us.
0,"Big Mountain, Big Format, Small Film","Imax is a stunning film format, and climbing Everest is an awe-inspiring subject - so how come this film leaves you so cold and conveys so little of the human struggle. The script has all the depth of an exercise bike commercial, and while the climbers rise to 28000ft their insights never rise above the ""I love to climb, thats why I do it"" level. The huge irony was that the film was made the year of the biggest tradgedy in the mountains history and you still ended up thinking that you could easily get up to the top on a nice sunday afternoon stroll and be down for supper."
1,History -- in living Color!,"From the time that Skye deserts the British vessel holding him captive to his meeting with the mountain men and Indians, I was held captive and felt as if I took each step into this new world with him. Mr. Wheelers use of historical facts and people, ie: the Hudson Bay company, Jim Bridger etc. just added to the overall effect of the story. I feel as tho I have gained a little more insight into the way the early trappers lived and faced death on a daily basis.I will look forward to reading his previous novels on Mister Skye -i backward order to see just where he went from this point on. Anyone who enjoys the historical novel will enjoy this one. Thanks for a trip into the past!"
1,Breathtaking,"I am simply at a loss for words for Darren Hayes's The Time Machine Tour Dvd. For a man that did the whole thing out of his own pocket (including his album) this is one of the best shows I have ever seen and I regret not being able to see it live.This is a must own for any fan of concerts, music, pop music and of course Darren."
1,A Tiger Shark and Another Perspective,"This Is Your Oceans: Sharks is different from other shark documentaries out there and is a documentary that many people are not yet ready to see. The star of the documentary is an individual tiger shark known among many divers affectionately as Emma. Emma is a 14-foot tiger shark and an occasional visitor to lucky divers who visit her domain in the Bahamas. I had the opportunity to meet her in April 2010 with Jim Abernethy, featured in the film, and saw her swim up to Jim like a great cat meeting an old friend. This relationship between Emma and Jim, built up over years, allows for the signature moment in the film between the two.In the 1960s the world could not believe that men could interact in the water with another great predator - the orca, aka killer whale. Welcome to the 2010s. Be ready for the next underwater surprise."
1,Perfect cup of coffee!,"My parents are big coffee drinkers and I wanted to make sure they got their coffee in the morning when they were visiting. I picked up the refurb DTC-975 when it was on sale. The unit that arrived was actully the newer model (pictured here) with the stainless steel filter basket above. It looked great with minimal indications it wasn't brand-spanking new. (Surface marks, etc.)Not only did this unit make a great cup of coffee; the carafe kept the coffee hot and fresh all morning. Very happy with the purchase.UPDATE: I just added a photo of the coffee maker to the customer images. Enjoy!"
0,Not my cup of tea!!!! Horrible character development,"The Female characters in this book were either vapid and silly (Andine/Leitha) or annoyingly cute and sarcastic (Dweia). The characters aren't really fleshed out...Eliar is basically a pig who eats alot...that's all we really know about him...the others are pretty shallow as well...I really think it is unoriginal and very unmoving...when all the characters in the book fall in love with each other and live happily ever after...it's too fake and too convenient....give me a book with challenge, struggle, betrayal....tragic love...heroic destiny.,..something that really grips you and gets you going....This book is the opposite...lovey dubey cute couples traveling together on a cliche mission to save the world. Please!!"
0,Very disappointing - Why did Oprah choose this one????,"This could have been a good book if it had been completed. It skipped all over the place, never fully developing the characters. I was interested in the Haitian culture and I was interested in the women, but it just did not flow. We jumped into the middle of the next step of their lives without knowing how we got there."
0,"It's ok, very overrated though","This album isn't nearly as good as most from other solid state bands. I really don't see why Demon Hunter has such big status in the Christian hardcore scene, there are a few good songs though, like ""my throat is an open grave"". Seriously, if you like this you should check out some Norma Jean, Underoath, Zao, Few Left Standing, Living Sacrifice, Beloved, Narcissus, or Unearth. Those are some good bands. And for the record, they sound NOTHING AT ALL like slipknot, I have no idea where anybody got that crazy, retarded thought in their head."
0,Who cares??,"This album reminds me of a supposed quote from Maria Callas. Callas while listening to a radio broadcast of another soprano turned to her companion and said. ""What a lovely voice! But who cares???"" Ms Fleming sings everything with great beauty and lush tone but no character! Not once did I feel she was involved in any of these womens situations. Butterfly and Manon may as well be the same woman. If you want to hear how some of this music can really sound buy almost any album by Rentata Scotto,Maria Callas or Renata Tebaldi."
1,"Simple title, Silly cover.","Yet somehow it equals and surpasses many classics of literature, fantasy or otherwise. No one will believe me, yet it's true that the Knight and the Wizard are better than any Tolkien, Martin or Jordan (I'm not just guessing, I've read them all). Wolfe's prose may go over many a reader's head. The writing style and complexity is on par (for comparison purposes) to that of Philip Pullman, Guy Gavriel Kay, David Foster Wallace or Thomas Pynchon and a story as exciting as Zelazny (Lord of Light, Amber Chronicles) or the best pulp fictions. Lord Dunsany and Edmund Spenser are the closest of Wolfe's peers. If you think you're up to the challenge then you should definitely pick this up. Not many author's give their readers such a sense of reward for reading."
1,A nice Christmas Treat,The music is subtle yet festive and a nice change of pace from many of the traditional song of the season.
0,This game sucks,"I spent hours upon hours of walking around in this game. Plus, the combat system was terrible. It took literally 10 tries to hit someone. The cities were way to large, and the maps were very confusing. Unless you want to spend HOURS walking around and jumping, pass this game up."

1,N Sync No Strings attached rules You have to buy it!,This album rules. the songs are so catchy. They guys sing great on it. So if you want good parting music buy this CD. You'll love it.
1,shedding light on other characters,"Sure, this book might not be 100% about Richard/Kahlan, etc. like the majority of the previous books were, and though I found it odd at first, eventually I came to enjoy the book as thoroughly as I had the others. It was nice to start with ""new"" characters for once--getting to know new faces in the series is always interesting. Keeping so many characters balanced and well written is no easy task--yet Goodkind has done it again! ;) A superb book for any die-hard lover of this series."
1,fun family flick,It's always tough for me to find movies that my son wants to watch that are not violent...this was enjoyed by our whole family :)
1,Practical and thought provoking,"This is an excellent book that will challenge and expand your view of spiritual mentors/directors. I read this book with my small women's group and we got a lot out of it. The best part is it not only talks about spiritual direction, but it also gives practical advice and examples. It is both theoretical AND practical in nature, which is sometimes hard to find. Highly recommend!"
0,"I think already heard this album, except it was Euphoria","Hardcore Lepps fans will be disappointed again, they have lost their edge. I guess Steve really was that important! The thing is, I love Def Leppard, but all of these sappy songs just can't stand up next to all the great songs from Pyro and Hysteria. It is WAY better than ""Slang"" though.."
1,Crazies=Scary,"The Crazies is suspense,horror,action,and sci-fi all wrapped up in one excellently done movie. The residence of a small town begin going mad 1 by 1 and all hell breaks loose. The military moves in and they may be as bad if not worse than the crazies, it is up to the Sheriff and his Deputy to save the day,or are they going crazy too? If you like suspense and action/horror you will like the Crazies."
0,Has nice photos but not too useful,I felt like my wife and I would've been better off just Googling things to see ideas. There were a lot of photos in the book but it was hard to get usable ideas from this. Most of the ideas were far too lavish and expensive to do or they'd take so much creative genius to create that they were impossible for us. I wish we'd bought a different book.
0,Waste for your Money,It is just wasting for the money. Nothing special about this book. you are better reading the help file which come with CRM software. Beside the help file is more organized by providing the steps in order.
1,Underrated Lennon,"I've always felt ""Mind Games"" was Lennon's most underrated album. While the title song itself is a bit cloying, many of the songs on the album are full of interesting guitar chords and a variety of song styles. Uptempo rockers like ""Meat City"" and ""Freeda Peeple"" sit comfortably next to gentle love songs like ""One Day at a Time"" and ""You Are Here"". In the middle are songs like ""Intuition"" and ""Only People"". Lyrically, this is not Lennon's best album, but it's highly ""listenable"", especially following the bombast of ""Sometime in New York City""."
0,Not great....,The snap fastener for the badge was always coming unsnapped and didn't really have the holding power necessary to keep the badge attached. My badge was always falling off and getting lost. I eventually had to stop using the product.
1,Quality Case--Well worth the price!,"I bought this case for my Luna Phoenix Acoustic Electric guitar. It has a plush velvet interior with a nice velvet pad that goes across the guitar body. This is a backpack case which is great for travel or just walking around. It has a very generous front pocket for songbooks, etc. Just make sure to pick the right case for your guitar. Luna offers several styles to fit different models and it is a very snug fit, so do some research and get the right case."
0,Yuck,From one Grobanite to all the rest out there- this album is a disgrace. None of these artists can even begin to touch Josh Groban's music (most artists can't). The only chills going up my spine with this album are in disgust. I highly recommend buying one of Josh's real albums...Josh deserves a much better tribute then this!

0,Drinking and Driving:A Dead End,"I read the review for this item and thought surely I won't encounter the same thing. I did. and when you try to contact GoMedia the producer, all you receive is a message saying the mailbox is full and cannot accept any new messages and then you are told to leave a message. A lot of help that is. It gets one star because this site won't allow me to rate it lower."
1,"Led Zeppelin, the best band that ever played","I'm 17 years old, and a huge fan of Zeppelin, I bought my first Zeppelin album when I was 10, and it was the 4th album. I couldn't believe how great the music was then. Anyway, this box set is a necessity for any Zep fan, also buy BBC Sessions, you will then have a complete Zeppelin Experience."

1,Best on Subject so Far!!!,"I've been a realtor for over a year and it amazes me how many realtors don't know about this or care. This one is the best book on the subject of Tax Liens to date that I have read. Read 16% Solution a while ago, not bad just outdated, but this book gives details. Even sat in on a few tax lien seminars, be very careful of these. If you are serious about getting good information and a good start without the bull on tax lien investing, put you money here. I did."
0,NOT SO PLEASED,This is not the first Fix It and Forget It cookbook that I have bought. The binding was on the wrong side. But this one I bought as a gift and did not have the time to exchange it. Imbarassing..it looked like a seconds gift. How was this overlooked when packed?
1,Influential and Important,"This is great music, made more important by the passage of time. I urge you to listen and learn. As usual, Hip-O has done a superb job: great sound, rare photos, and an essay that adds detail and dimension to the legacy of the Impressions. Hear for yourself why this music matters more than ever."
0,Disappointing,"I was really disappointed by this book. I continued to read it, thinking it would improve. I was so impressed by cutting for stone that I was expecting the same level of writing. However, the story dragged on and was almost predictable."
0,Totally Awful,"I have never written a review, but I figure I'd better warn those hardcore action movie enthusiast. It's just all wrong. It's a chick flick disguised as an action movie. Other than the few flashback clips, there is nothing that would convince me that this guy really is or has ever been a monk.Pretty decent martial arts choreography at times, but that's where the talent ends (I guess that's why I fell asleep twice 15 min into the movie). The rest was just a big disappointment,Silly and awful acting,Very long and boring periods between the action. Terrible script. It seems like they played the same crappy background music through the whole film, it's more like a martial arts soap opera, If I had a choice of watching this movie again, or having my toenails ripped from my flesh, I'd opt for the latter."
0,poorly made,"Kids enjoy it, but poorly made. Fabric not sewn on well and thin. Don't expect to last more than 6 months without being totally torn."
1,Sweet story about life and family,"""Marley and Me"" is entertaining and touching. It's a really sweet story with honest glimpses of life and starting a family. Owen Wilson's and Jennifer Aniston's performances are great."
0,only 15-20 minutes running time,"I have a fairly long driveway and using electrical extension cords are always a pain. I though a cordless blower would be a good option to clear our driveway of debris. The battery died after 15 minutes and I had only finished clearing half my driveway. I called B&D because the manual says to call the company before returning the product. ""Mam the blower only has 15 minutes of running time on that battery."" Had I known in advance I might not have purchased it. If you have a small yard, deck, driveway this might work for you. Didn't work for me. Another option is to have a backup battery so you can replace it as soon as the first one drains out of power."
0,"Wonderful children's book, but......","I enjoyed reading this book, but I fail to see how it can quite reach #4 (or thereabouts) in the Millennium pole. JK Rowling's writing reminds me of Enid Blyton's (a favourite of mine when I was a child). Older readers should look elsewhere for more meaty reading satisfaction (any of the SF classics should do the trick).Having said that, am happy that children are turning to books because of Mr. Potter!"
0,Why bother? Buy Metal ones!,"There is no clear advantage to using these silicone baking pans. I am a professional baker and I have used Silpats for years - but a baking pan is a different story.First, you have to either use a peel, as mentioned by another review, or a cookie sheet under them to get them in and out of the oven without having it destroy the cake.And then you have to spray, and even that doesn't always work. I used my one silicone pan and two metal pans. I sprayed all three. The cake stuck to my silicone pan so I ended up with a two layer cake instead of a three layer cake.The muffin pans are fine, but I would avoid any of the larger pans. For the cost, you can buy similar metal ones and do what you would always do - spray them!"
0,Defective Product,"I disagree with J. S. Thomas Jethro below. Amazon, once notified about the problem should have removed this listing until THQ rectifies the bad key code issue. Evidently they still have bad stock, as I received one last week. I wrote directly to THQ and they have not responded to me at all. I've requested a refund and will not repurchase this from Amazon unless directly notified by them that the issue is corrected."
0,It lodges in the mind as few recent novels have.,"The book is inspired, original... As the mountains gentle toward the sea-with mother and child locked in a ghostly grip-the narrative tact, the perfect economy of effect defy criticism. The analogies with Moby Dick are patent. Anna Quindlen invites the prodigous comparison. What more can one say?"
0,What a horrible book!,"This was selected to be read for our book club. First, it is not available as an e-book, so I had to buy the actual book. What a waste. The story itself is terrible. Nothing is fleshed out. This would be one of those stories that could be placed in installments in a magazine. The premise is also way out there. The author introduces things, but then lets them drop. For example - the police officer finds information from years past that somewhat 'predicts' what happens in the future. That's it. It goes nowhere else. Do not waste your money on this book. It is terrible."
0,It just doesn't sound right.,"On paper this CD looks like a can't miss. But while Siobhan De Mare's vocals were perfectly matched to the retro trip-hop of Mono's ""Formica Blues"", they sound strangely awkward here. Robin Guthrie's music is pure Cocteau Twins, and maybe that's part of the problem. After the first few notes you just can't wait to here Elizabeth Fraser's unique brand of gibberish floating dreamily over the ambient waves. But here, de Mare attacks and ultimately overwhelms the songs. It's grating to the ears and sadly unenjoyable."
0,Does Not Stick to Wall - Keeps falling off,"I have tried two of these. First one I returned because it would not stick to my closet wall, which is painted wood. I cleaned the surface too so it wasn't dirty. I got a replacement, and although it stayed stuck for a month, it too has now just starting popping off. Of course it started doing it after the 30-day return window, so now I'm having to negotiate with Amazon as to whether they will take it back. I think they should because it's the same defect twice.The light itself would have been sufficient for a dark closet, not something you'd want to read by, but it shows the color of your clothes. But as it is always on the floor nowadays, it's pretty useless."
0,***** Way to go Michael *****,"As a Lebanese citizen who is not much into politics, I saw the book with a friend so i took a peak on some of the contents inside. Couldn't wait for the next morning to buy me a copy. As a result, I finished reading it in three working days (It usually takes me at least 2-3 weeks to finish a book). Once you start with reading it, you can't stop. Stupid White Men is one of the most entertaining and full-of-facts book. It should be nominated ""book of the decade"". This book is a must-have in every library. If you haven't bought it, go ahead, do it immediatly"
0,False Image,The Primary Image used on Amazon says that this is a class 10 version of this card. with read write speeds of 30 MB/sIf you look under specifications it does say class 6 20 MB/s So it was partly my fault for not checking the specifications however I assumed it would match the image...Haven't gotten a chance to use the card yet still waiting on the camera to show up.
0,Looking for a document scanner - get the Fujitsu S300,"Since I didn't want to spend a fortune on a scanner I was debating for months whether to buy this Canon or one of the other models under $100. But as I mainly wanted it for documents, none of them seemed right. I recently stumbled on the Fujitsu Scansnap S300 - for $260 (there's also a model just for the Mac). After I blanched at the price, I read the reviews and took the plunge. If you're like me and mainly need a scanner for docs, this is the one. It is fabulous. I'm running Vista 32. Installiion is a snap. It is not a flatbed, but you can scan up to 12 docs at once, it scans both sides, and takes seconds. The included Organizer software is really easy to use. It's well worth the extra $."
1,Works Fine,"I use this knife sharpener every day. I bought it because it is small & quiet. I have an electric knife sharpener which is probably more effective but is very noisy so I don't use it very often. The smaller, more portable Henckels does the trick for most tasks."
1,Great Signal Capture,"Like many other reviewers, I needed a radio to get a weak FM signal for my NPR station (in my case, after I moved to a hilly area outside of the town where the broadcast originates). My dedicated stereo tuner could not get this, with an *amplified* antenna. I set up the Tivoli with the simple wire antenna included, and bingo - there it was as clear as could be. To be sure it's only a mono demodulation, but with the excellent speaker design, it's great sound for the price. This is easily worth the price. One confusing point is a single ""Rec"" RCA jack, suggesting that this could be connected to a *stereo* (the instructions term) - two things wrong with that: (1) it's a single jack, so it has to be mono, and (2) you'll need to turn down the volume as the radio's speaker stays on (which is acknowledged in the directions). With these caveats, this is highly recommended."

0,Anne lost me,"I was disappointed with this book, if only because the other Vampire Chronicles have such great storylines. Although I did enjoy reading Anne's interpretation of God and the Devil, I think both Lestat and the reader suffer. The story of Creation and such drag on and on while the ending of the book is too short and too weak. I'm left wondering what the next Chronicle has in store for Lestat...hopefully it's much more than this."
1,If you need a pick me up.......................THIS is it,"This book was kind of like an ice cold glass of Lemonade on a one hundred degree day. REFRESHING. A total, completely REAL, down to earth story. Hilariously fulfilling this book is about your Aunts, cousins, and girlfriends,a few guys you know, and it may just even be about you. This is your next book for your ""book club"". This book will make you laugh till you cry, and then it will just pick you up and make you appreciate so many things. Your girlfriends, your man, and your self resolve. This book is a definite page turner, that you will not put down until...THE END"
0,JUNK.,"Breaks easy, and hardly works. Spend the extra dime to get a good product. Pretty much all I have to say on this..."
1,Cross over music that works brilliantly,I heard Summer on a sampler cd I got for free from one of the local bookstores. I kept coming back to her song and liked it enough to order her entire cd from amazon. Great purchase to say the least. She moves effortlessly between classical and pop selections. She has a way of working within the song and not overextending - meaning she doesn't showboat. Don't expect any american idol grandstanding at any time. What you get is straight up professional singing from a classicaly trained vocalist. It doesn't get boring thanks to a great mix of songs. The treatment of Sting's 'fragile' is especially nice. Not an essential cd but I still give it 5 stars because it's practically flawless.
0,Comparison shopping,"This movie has two things in its favor (thus, my two* rating): 1. Great outdoor scenery (on the seldom-photographed Indian Ocean island of Reunion); 2. The opportunity to see both its stars (Deneuve and Belmondo) in their prime and without their shirts.Otherwise, forget it.The 2000 remake entitled Original Sin is less talky, more suspenseful, cheaper in cost (at least on Amazon), has an American (as opposed to a French) ending, and also features topless (and bottomless) stars (Jolie and Banderas). The novella to which both movies owe their inspiration, Waltz into Darkness (by the same guy who wrote Rear Window), is better than either movie, and has the best ending (truly noir) of all. All three versions require a definite suspension of disbelief. As a couple other reviewers of one or the other of the movie versions asked: ""How could anybody (i.e., the Belmondo/Banderas character) be so dumb?"""
1,I laughed. Alot,"This book was absolutely hilarious. I don't care if all of it was made up. It wasn't, he says. If so, I honestly believe that his life inspired ""The Hangover"". Because it is just that wild. Read this. You need to.It's got humor for all types here. Smart humor, drunk humor, sarcasm and lots of sex. Funny sex usually.If you made a movie, I'm already looking for it. Otherwise make one. It might make you rich."

1,rescue remedy helps,"I have a cat who chronically overgrooms. Something will set her off and she increases this problematic behavior. I have been using Rescue Remedy for about one month and it has reduced, but not eliminated the problem. I am seeing regrowth of hair, but there are still patchy spots. She is quite fussy when I try to administer anything, so I put a few drops on Temptation treats twice a day and she eats them up. I've tried the collar and other lotions, so short of RX medication, Rescue Remedy has produced the most positive results."
1,Great movie,Such an excellent movie. I am going to watch it over and over again. It's a great watch with the hubby.
0,It just doesn't work!!!,"I ignored the recent negative reviews that states that this product only boost signal within 5 feet of the unit, which is exactly what it does. So it doesn't work because I cannot be within 5 feet of the unit most of the time; my house is bigger than that. And the sad thing is that I was hoping it would strengthen as time goes by, until the return date expired which I forgot to monitor. If you buy this product and it only works within 5 feet return it immediately."
0,Stay away from this piece of JUNK!,Bought this for Christmas for my 8 year old. Took one picture and the film would not stop at the next advancement stage and the shutter would not even snap. I Will be taking this back to Toys-R-Us. this is the most worthless piece of crap I have ever seen. It is cheaply built and you have to take out two tiny screws just to replace the battery. Don't waste your money or another roll of film trying to make it work like I did. I thouht Little Tikes made durable stuff for kids. Not stuff that Breaks or don't even work at all.
1,"""Feels Like Home"" doesn't make me feel at home.","""Feels Like Home"" doesn't make me feel at home. ""Come Away With Me"" is a much better CD. Why? The lyrics are more touching, the rhythym calms you and relaxes you on ""Come Away With Me"".Norah didn't even spend the time to write most of the songs and I'm kinda disapointed. None the less, ""Feels Like Home"" is still better than most mainstream artists' CD's (Britney Spears' ""In the Zone"" anyone?) ""Feels at Home"" is still soothing though.For me, grunge, punk rock band Nirvana have something in common with Norah Jones believe it or not. When lead singer Kurt Cobain screams, it gets you through rough times. I find the same thing with Norah Jones, except she doesn't scream.If I were a beginner Norah Jones fan, I would get ""Come Away With me"" out of the two albums. Still, ""Feels Like Home"" is a decent follow-up."
1,Great History,"I have loved reading this book. It is about a man who follows Joseph Smith and became his personal body guard. It shows their friendship over the years and how hard it was to live back then. It is great and sad too. I love it. It is a great part of history to read.The only thing I don't like is all the extra pages the author leaves in between the chapters, what was he thinking???"

At least six adults claimed father John Powell abused them in the late 60's and 70's. No criminal charges were filed against Powell but the priest has admitted to the abuse.--ABC NewsTwo of the former Chicago Jesuit priest John Powell's victims spoke out Thursday. Patrice Regnier says Father Powell -- a former Loyola University professor -- started abusing her when she was 12 years old. She just received a settlement.""The idea people found from me speaking the truth that they could come out themselves and speak the truth is a good thing,"" said Patrice Regnier, victim of sexual abuse.Diane Ruhl says she was abused at 17 years old by Father Powell on the Loyola campus when she was a student. She confronted him 30 years later by writing him. He responded and admitted to the abuse in his letters."

1,"SHELBY--Cobra, Mustang and Dodge by Steve Statham","There have been many books written on the automotive creations of Carroll Shelby, but this one stands out in 2 ways. The photographs (many of which were taken by the author himself) are fantastic, and the section detailing Mr. Shelby's years with the Chrysler Corporation is first rate. Every Shelby-Dodge fan needs to have this book.....period!"

1,Best of 10000,"I am a major Natalie fan, and this is by far the best cd by 10000 maniacs. This cd includes Gun Shy, which Natalie just released on her new album, live. Enjoy"
0,Total nonsense,"Pleeaase! This is not the dark forbidden, but a real nonsense starting with SP - almost nun deflowered ritually with drugged dagger by a spy/sexually abused/sex maniac hero..."
0,Not happy..yet.,"After reading the reviews this seemed like a good purchase, except for people saying that either they did not work when they arrived, or they died soon after. I ordered two, and when they arrived, one did not work. I have sent it back and we will see how long it takes to replace and if the new one works."
1,Look No Further!,"Was debating on spending the money on this canner, as I am new to this and wasnt sure how it was going to turn out. Searched ALL OVER THE WEB and read reviews from several manufacturers of different canners and ultimately decided on this one...I have the philosophy if your going to do something, do it right the first time...I cant speak highly enough for this canner! I was intimidated at first because it sounded complex compared to some others, but let me assure you, super simple to learn how to use, easily maintained, and ROCK SOLID construction (MADE IN USA!! - china could learn a thing or two...) Anyway if you are reading this and are looking for a canner, just stop, and buy this one. (Also called Wisconsin Foundry FYI if you want to price check, but AMAZON was the cheapest I found for the 921). Word to wise though, make sure you ""olive oil"" the seal, and pick up a rubber mallet to tap the lid off after done...its amazing how good the metal on metal seal works :)"
1,"Dangerous Women, dangerous times","Forgotten in the dust of history are the women who fought, who financed and who fanned the flames of war and independence but were forgotten in the male-dominated history books. Reading level is about fourth grade, great graphics, text is engaging and stories are short. Although the text is somewhat ""bloodless"" this title is bound to get some readers excited about finding out more about these ladies."
1,Great Snap Ring Pliers,"I tried a generic brand of pliers (OEM) from Auto Zone to pull a snap ring off the lower control arm ball joint, and it wouldn't take it off. I bought this SK set which I should have done in the first place, and wallah. These snap ring pliers are very durable, and should last a life time."
0,Mediocre First Single Off New Album,"As far as talent goes, I feel that Steps have a lot to offer. After running into their first CD, ""Step One"", at London's Gatwick Airport during the summer of '99, I just knew I had to have the CD. That is when I first got into the Steps sound. Now, over a year later, I still have a great respect for Steps....kind of an ABBA for the new millenium. However, with STOMP, the first single off of their latest album, I am a little bummed. The vocals on this one are excellent, and most of the credit I give the song is due to the singers themselves. However, the actual song itself is a bit boring and barely memorable. It is a re-hashed disco song with very little of anything too interesting. The first couple of times I heard it, I thought it was pretty decent, but now I am sick and tired of it. Not a strong offering from this U.K. bubblegum group."
0,Kindle Price is MORE than the book price??,"So now the Kindle price is MORE than the book price?? What the F. Great book. I love the Kindle device. BUT the price of Kindle books (NO printing, NO shipping, NO handling, NO storage, it was SUPPOSED to be cheaper) is a RIP-OFF. Amazon is guilty of FALSE ADVERTISING. I just bought this book used on eBay from Goodwill for $4.37, free shipping."
0,Do Not Purchase unless you want disappointed child,"I am a sewing teacher and have had 2 students frustrated, dejected, and upset after attempting to use this toy. Because that is what it is..a TOY...the threading mechanism is too small or difficult to access, the tension cheap, and without a light its impossible to see what you're doing. I have advised these parents to send this back and purchase a 3/4 size Janome, the Hello Kitty version if available instead. The foot pedal is under powered, the arm of the machine so small and shaped to make it difficult to move fabric through it..I was sadly motivated to post this review when my second student was unable to sew a stitch due to the poor quality of this product. Save your money."
1,"Excellent design, uniquely simple.....","I received my ""new"" coffeepot yesterday. and am enjoying my 3rd brew as I type this. As a retired engineer, I was surprised at it's simple, nearly idiot-proof design. It takes up about 1/3 of the space as my previous 12 cup coffeemaker.This coffeemaker does exactly what it was designed to do, make an excellent cup of coffee (5cups/2mugs) and nothing else, no bells, whistles, or timers and alarms.....one simply labeled and illuminated switch, on/off.The filter holder is unique in it's design, it sits within the pot's lid. It is designed in a very simple, but interlocking manner. nearly impossible to assemble wrongly. Also it's ergonomically designed lid/handle tends to lead your thumb to cover the tab that holds the lid while pouring.If you are a single person or a couple, and don't require more than 5 cups at a time, and don't need a clock/timer to reset after power failures, then this is the pot for you!Forgot to mention...the spout does not drip either!!"
1,A very beautiful love story,"This is actually a very sad love story sweetly sold. I saw it many times and I still feel the sadness, the desperate feelings of not being able to be with the one you love, and the sweetness of being loved even in another life..."
1,Gunfighter,Fantastic portrat of the man of myth and legend. Anyone can make as much as they want out of this account
1,This is wonderful,"I really liked this workout. I have a six year old and it's great to set aside some ""me"" time for an hour and do the whole thing. I really worked up a sweat during the two cardio sections, and the sculpting section was great. Loved it!"
0,Funny Parts--Lame Overall,"I adore Jack Nicholson, and that's why I went to see this movie. I doubt I'd given it a second thought had he not been in it, because I'm not a big Adam Sandler fan. (Sandler was surprisingly not obnoxious, as he tends to be.)I laughed quite a few times. There definitely were entertaining parts of the movie. However, the storyline was incredibly stupid. I wanted to like it so much, but I walked out of the cinema thinking ""What is Jack Nicholson doing in a lame movie like that?!"""
0,AUthor Author,"DVD was delivered in good time, faster than stated. DVD was in good condition. HOwever was disappointed to find that the DVD version crops off the original beginning and 10 minutes off the end. The oriinal screen and VHS version ends with a celebration the next day in Ivan's bedroom with the kids hitting Ivan with a cake! The DVD version ends on the street the night before in front of the news stand. Disappointing."
0,Stopped working on 4th use,"This vaccuum stopped working on its 4th use. It was adequate as a vaccuum, although bulky and difficult to store. It is very loud as a vaccuum. As a leaf blower it is underpowered but relatively quiet.This was a lousy value, and I will stay a long way away from the shop vac brand from now on. I advise everyone to keep on shopping if they are looking at shop vac."
1,"Samsung HL-S6186W 61"" DLP HDTV","I was Fry's looking at the Sony KDS60A2000 and Samsung HL-S6186W. The Sony was a 1080p and cost $1300 more than the Samsung which is only 1080i. I decided to buy the Samsung based on the following.1. Currently, no cable or dish provide broadcast at 1080p. They only broadcast at 1080i. So why pay more for a for something I can't get anyways.2. When it's all said and done, I'll be saving almost $1300.3. Quality wise I can't tell the difference between the Sony and SamsungI would recommend you comparing the 2 side by side to see if the it's worth it."
1,If you dont have this... your stuck in the 80's and you wont sell!,The sales bible is the bible of sales... no joke... no compromise... its really the new way of selling that has changed from the 80's to 2000! Get this or you will really fall behind!
1,It's a beauiful song!,"I love that song it was my friends wedding song at there wedding. My husband and I got married the same day and we had ""Still the one"" by her, so a lot of us love her music up here in Maine."
0,instructions are faulty,Gave instructions to place a pin in the holes you can see in the drawing. It was to activate the spring when mounting the hinge. No pin was included which made these expensive hinges useless.
1,layzie does it again!,"This album is hot as hell.This ain't livin, ís one of the greatest songs layzie has made in the last couple of years.If you're a true Bone fan you want this album."
0,Very nice until they crack. Not recommmended.,The canisters work very well at keeping food fresh. EXCEPT they crack after using a few times with just hand washing. Small cracks develop at the bottom center radiating out. They will continue to hold a seal for a short while until the cracks become larger then no more seal. The attachment to vacuum seal canning jars works very well but is not practical for storing items that are used frequently.
1,Not your traditional E.T.,"I just rented this last night and it has everything a movie needs to be successful. It's exciting, touching,and thought provoking. It basically asks,""What would happen if the sweet little E.T. of 1982 had been bigger, captured, held prisoner for 20+ years abused and then gets lose?""As an audience we are first scared with the the abundance of confusion and at the end we are angry at the inhumane humans and then deeply touched by the simple love of family that finally is realized.This movie is great for all age levels but if there are family members younger than 8, Mom or Dad should be there as support because it's got some graphic scenes."
1,The Only Rechargables that work with my Flash,I will only buy these rechargeables from now on. They are the only ones powerful enough for my Canon 580 flash.
1,An absorbing read,"I very much recommend this book. The author has a wry, quirky point of view about China and he conveys many vivid experiences and perceptions, leaving the reader with a disturbing sense of how hard it is to penetrate the Chinese psyche."
1,Kameleon - better than 5 remotes!,"I purchased the kameleon to replace 5 remotes - digital cable, tv, stereo, vcr, and DVD player and intentionally purchased the 8-device so that I had room to spare. THe setup was quite nice and I like the remote's functionality. There are cases when a button from the old remote aren't part of the new setup, but you can manually program specific buttons to perform that function. I love the marcros - I push one button and my TV goes to the correct input signal, my dvd starts playing, my stereo receiver changes to dvd input & my cable box shuts off. Very nice...."
0,Not worth the money,"Fun while it lasted, but that is it. Didn't even make it through one set of batteries before one bullet died. Look elsewhere."
0,I didn`t find any value:(,I purchased this on a reccomendation-everthing I`ve read so far I`d already read on the web-so my opinoin is-save your $ and look it up online.
0,Hard to use,"I found this scanner difficult to use, especially trying to line up the paper to feed through the scanner. The software is poorly designed and organized. There is no on-off button and no light to let you know if the scanner is on. It is stupid beyond belief to not have an on-off switch or at least a light to indicate the status. As to the software, what were they thinking? Badly designed hardware, badly designed software, what was I thinking? (Actually, it was made by Visioneer so I thought it would be pretty well designed--I won't make that mistake again. I really wonder if when a company releases a bad product they ever consider what effect it has on the company's reputation. Obviously, Visioneer does not and I'd say that reflects the poor leadership of the top person in the company.)"
0,Don't be a fool,"This book constitutes an attempt to cash in on a four-year relationship with Jim Cramer. In reality, Nicholas Maier never got close enough to Cramer to come up with any interesting information we couldn't find on the book's cover. Only a fool what compare this author to Michael Lewis while purchasing this book."
0,Don't buy this washer,"This is absolutely, positively the worst washer. After the washer was just out of warranty, we opened the door to find that the tub was half filled with water. The water dumped out and damaged the wood floor. We had both the hot and cold water valves replaced and the washer worked for another year or so. A couple days ago, I was standing next to the washer after it completed the wash cycle and turned off. I heard what sounded like water running. Further investigation lead me to find out that the cold water was still going into the tub. Just to clarify, the washing machine cycle had been completed. I looked in the front door and saw that the tub was half filled with water.This washer is out-of-here. I will never buy an LG appliance again. Wasted money, damaged floors, repair bills. The cost the replace the washer was just a fraction of the cost to repair the damage the machine did."
1,five people you meet in heaven,"thought provoking material I think we all wonder about the legacy we will leave behind and what we really look forward to. the ""five people you meet in heaven."""
0,Great Gag Gift,"If you have friend who's a Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon fanatic, manga/comic book lover, this would be a great gag gift. Page after page of hilariously bad dialogue. Spitting out horrible line after horrible line. The drawing isn't the greatest either. the characters have huge foreheads and bodies sometimes out of proportion. If nothing else, the only redeeming quality about this horrible exploitation of a movie franchise, is the main male character proclaims something along the lines of: 'She is sixteen, She is Perfect!'"
1,Great Headphones!,"I'm not all into having the smallest thing on my head. I'd rather have great sounding headphones. That's what you get with these...great sounding headphones!The closed design makes for wonderful bass response, and to keep out some of the noise going on around you.I like the way they fold up, and I've had no problems with them at all.Considering how much some headphone makers charge...sometimes just for the name, these are a lot of ""bang for the buck"". I would buy them again, and would recommend these to anyone."
1,Awesome scissors!,"Based on prior reviews, I gave these a try. Specifically wanted them to cut up chicken for my dogs who are on a raw meat diet. These scissors cut through breast meat bones as well as thigh meat bones with ease. Recommend these scissors highly! I even bought a second pair - just in case ;)"
1,Perfect glass cleaner for my 2.5 gallon,"I have a 2.5 planted betta tank and with the light I use, it was constantly getting a film over the glass. This mini mag float was the perfect size (and the magnet was quite powerful to my surprise) for this little tank."
1,Tuttis trombones,My father had Tuttis trombones when I was a kid. Some of the best musicians coupled with great arrangements. Makes you want to play the trombone.
1,This Is Jane's Addiction At Their Finest!,This is a must-have for ANY Jane's Addiction fan. The remixes are amazing and anything new to come out of them is an immediate must-have. No matter wetheryou prefer them live in concert or in the studio this album captures all the energy and creativity coming out of them.
0,Very disappointing ending,"What a waste: the author of two horror classics yearning to ""transcend the genre."" Is the ending a dream sequence or hypnotic/drug induced trance, or will the next installment find Clarisse and Hannibal digging up Jean-Paul Sartre's remains and gnawing on them? Who cares! As I finished this book, I was embarrassed for Thomas Harris, to think that this sloppy denouement was the best he could produce after so many years, particularly when the first half of the book is so well done. Harris wants to have it both ways: he wants the readers that Lecter's gory exploits bring, but he also wants to be taken seriously as an artiste. He has become the literary equivalent of Quentin Tarantino, by confusing self-indulgence with creativity."
1,It worked.,It did eliminate the red in my hair but unfortunately it did leave it a little darker than it would normally be. I will still be using it again. I would rather go a little darker than a little redder.
1,"19 songs of ""pure country""","One of the all-time country greats who is often overlooked these days. In this cd, you get a sampling of the hits and classic album cuts from the 50's and early 60's. Stonewalls music is ""real country"" at it's very best."
1,works as advertised,works great for insertion..those stubborn quad sheild cables can be a bugger to put f connectors on sometimes..with this they slide on like butta.
0,Writing via auto-fill,"Is it appropriate that the author writes like a lazy ""C"" student? After just a few pages, you realize she uses the exact same phrases on EVERY page. Couldn't help but wonder how much work she actually put into actual research. Did she simply gather a few brochures from schools to craft this book? Two stars for having the info in one place, I guess."
1,A different side of Sarah,"The songs on this CD are great, and showcases Sarah's pop side... Her rendition of Love Changes Everything is intimate and beautiful. The song Brown Eyes is lyrical and soothing. A must for any Brightman fan. It reminds the listener where she got her start."
1,"readers, beware!","this is a work on shapeshifting i picked up several years ago, and found i wasn't ready to read. my first experience in shifting was spontaneous and felt completely natural, but no one around me truly understood when i tried to describe how it occurred and what it felt like. this work has a rhythm and a cadence to it that prepares you for the experience, and simplifies many of its aspects. enormously helpful, but be prepared to enter the realm of looking through other eyes. thank you for sharing, michele jamal!"
1,Better than her other contemporary novels,"I'm a big fan of McNaught's historical novels while at the same time I detest all of her contemporary novels. Except this one. I truly enjoyed this one, much to my surprise. In the past I struggled to finish novels like ""Paradise"". The novel featuring Zack and Julie I never finished. But this book had tones of ""Once and Always"" and ""Whitney, My Love"". I couldn't set this one down. I snuck it into work with me and finished it in my office. If she can't give us another great historical novel, I can take another novel like this anytime."
0,Where is the River ?,"I bought this movie thinking it was a classic. It was,instead, a waste of time. Amazon might even advertise instant video cannot be watched over HDMI before you rent one."
0,A toy but poorly made,"My 4 year old wanted a guitar for her birthday and she wanted this one. I understand that because she is 4, going a less expensive route is best. However, I wasn't expecting the guitar to look used and damaged. There was a big ding by the neck, a chunk of wood fell out of the guitar, the paint work was shotty at best, the strings don't stay tight and it didn't have a peg by the neck to attach the strap to, so the strap is useless. My daughter plays it, but I was expecting the guitar to be new, looking that way as well as expecting it to work properly. I am disappointed."
1,A clear message delivered in a brilliant video.,"I've been a fan of Brian Dunning's ""SKEPTOID"" podcast for a long time now, and I'm delighted by the success of this video.Dunning uses this video to explain, in common language, how people might be misled and how you can protect yourself as a consumer. He also addresses one of my favorite attacks: the Red Herring.People using scientific instruments are not necessarily scientists! People wearing labcoats aren't necessarily doctors! (and people wearing chefs jackets aren't necessarily trained chefs, but that's a personal pet peeve...)By the way, ""kostas_the_ancient_priest"", did you actually watch the video? Specifically, about 15-20 minutes in, where Dunning mentions ""Proof by Verbosity""? He's talking to you! :-)"
1,Twelve Weeks to Fertility,"Finally,a method for putting it all together.I feel hopeful and even excited about the process.Excellent ,simple , mind/body program recommended by DR Marrs in his book."
0,"Nice mug, but...","I purchased this mug for my husband, and purchased 4 of the Dragonfly - Just Believe Ceramic Travel Mug from another seller. Except for the design on the mug, the mugs appear identical. What puzzles me and stops this from being a 5-star review is that the lid for this mug does not fit tight; its so loose you cannot tip it to drink from it without the lid falling out. So much for a travel mug."
1,great for those who love to get their scratched,"I have a cerebellar hypoplasia cat, so it makes playing difficult for her. I have never seen her play with a toy. However, she went nuts over this brush and was rubbing her face in the bristles, rubbing against it, playing with the base, rolling on her back and swatting at it, etc. She is an adult (3yrs) and some reviews said it takes a while for cats to figure out what to do, but she got it right away.Best cat purchase I ever made."
0,junk,"I recieved the monitor has a gift. I used it when I was at my parents house, because the babys room is on the other side of the house. I kept hearing other peoples conversations and I thought that was normal. Then I started hearing ticking sounds, then one moring I woke up and it wasn't working. Luckly the baby was looking at her mobile just laying there. Then I would hear strange sounds coming from both ends. This is my first time using thos product and my baby is seven months old. I am very upset about this monitor........"
1,Excellent,"Definitely not for kids but at the same time funny with great music, Jack Black has proven himself along with Kyle Gas as great musicians with a flavor of humor!!!!!!"
0,Disappointed B&D Electric Knife(s)-,"Both the insertion of the knife blades into the B&D electic knife and using the on switch on the electric knife is not easy requring some dexterity. I understand the need for the safety device for the on switch when operating but this could have been designed better. The item was reordered thinking it was a flaw with the blades and the ""on switch"" and still waiting today (12/25/2012) for UPS to pick up return item (first electric knife) back to Amazon. Interesting enough, we reordered and received the 2nd ordered knife very timely and despite closely following instructions, the blade knife comes out slowly from its ""clicked on"" position after about fifteen seconds. We will be returning the 2nd knife once UPS picks up the first electric knife. Surprised that this being a B&D product that it does not work well compared to other electric knives I've used."
0,Save your money,It is unfortunate that someone with the credentials of this author could put out a book with such little substance. The flowery descriptions and vague detail are not suited to a book purchased for technical reference.
0,Disappointed - returned to Amazon,"The first time I plugged in this radio, the LCD display and power button flicked on and off continuously. After several resets, the problem still existed, so I sent it back to Amazon."
0,Twice tried and failed,Got one RF worked. reprogram some buttons and reprogram then RF never works again. it pairs fine but doesnt respond. Got another one from amazon (amazon rules) this one doesnt even show RF options on the remote. return again. still looking for good RF solution
1,This was a great book!,"I thought this book was excellent in every way of the childs point of veiw but the thing that kept me from making this a five star book was the interpretation that Ann Rinaldi gave of the schools. It shows she did very little research on the indian schools, especilly when Carlisle was such a big target. To make things worse, I am Native American and I am Sioux. My great grandmother was in an Indian ""school"" growing up and i think this school sounded just ""peachy"" compared to what she wen through. Otherwise, the book was good and Little Rose was a great character. The book would have been better if not perfect if Mrs. Rinaldi would have put more effort into accuracy and research! And I would also like to add, that all of you who thought this book was great in every way have much to learn about the indian ways. Do not give this to someone as a gift if they are strong in Native American history and facts, although you would be trying to be nice, it would only hurt more"
1,Does the job nicely.,"What can I say...It's a power cord. I bought this for my generator which I installed outside the house. Using the Reliance Controls outdoor plug receptacle mounted to the house, I needed a power cord to plug the generator into the receptacle.Most others I looked at where a lot more expensive than this one. I only needed 5-Feet, but this 10-foot cord worked fine.It's much thicker than I thought, is fully molded as one piece, so piece of mind should you be connecting everything in the rain.It's a great plug, with an attractive price.It does the job well."
1,Super!,"This is a particularly fiery show from Girlschool and features some standout tracks.From the opening blast of C'mon Lets Go the band sounds great and never lets up,the crowd is really into it (i think the show was recorded in Japan 1982?) and the atmosphere is intense.I'm really glad i picked this up -first rate heavy rock."
0,Yuck!!!!!!!,"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read! I had to read it for English class in eighth grade. If it wasn't assigned literature in most places, no one would ever read this book. It was incredibly stupid and boring. It was hard for me to read because it was so BORING! I almost fell asleep reading it. The ending was horrible, too. If you really want to read this book, then feel free, but if you're looking for recommendations, you won't get one from me. If you're really into historical fiction only because of the history in it, then this book is for you, but that's not how I am. All in all, for me this book was one of the biggest wastes of my time and I do NOT recommend it to anybody."
0,Disappointing,"Anja Silja is someone I respect, and I am all for 'grey power', but this is a performance too far. In the opening scene her light grey trouser suit makes her look like an elderly Scandinavian tourist. She does not look sexually desirable. Her attempts to be sensual are simply embarrassing, as are some of the outfits she later fits into. Furthermore her voice has none of the mysterious warm colouring of Söderstrom in the excellent Mackerras LP version and is often stridently off the note. The supporting cast, orchestra and conductor are fine. The staging is ok, but not very innovative. Finally, why could we not have a Czech singer in this role, someone who does not have to strain to pronounce correctly?"
0,Buy another brand.,I have had these for a couple of years but I don't use them because they don't stay on and are not comfortable. My old True Value leather ones have performed better. These just look fancy and I thought they would work better at the time.
0,Yet another of those..,"Just another mainstream sci-fi wanna-be-great film wrapped in a commercial packing. Watch it a dull sunday afternoon when there's nothing else on tv, but not worth buying on dvd."
1,"very good book, indeed","This is a very detailed, serious and logical system to get things done. You may or may not buy the whole system (lists and lists), but implementing some of his advice brings quick results. The alphabetical filing worked very well for me. Dating documents and information was also very valuable. This is simple but it works. I bought it at a time when I took a new job, and it helped me to be more organized and to process the backlog of work. What I discovered is that you still need to find your own organizing style. This guide is quite specific in its advice but you do not have to use the whole system. Just use the ""organizing"" blocks that suit your style. In the end, I am less frustrated with my organizing skills than before and I am going to re-read the book to improve my skills further."

0,"Looks good, didn't work","I like that way this holster cradles the phone without being cumbersome. The part that holds onto the phone is really slick.On my unit, the spring clip that holds it exploded the first day. Fell apart like a $3 watch. So I used it less than a day. Perhaps other have had better luck."
0,P.S. Your Movie Stinks!,"Just saw a pre-release copy of this last night. It was all the six of us who watched it could do to see the whole thing. Some problems:1. Jimmy's apartment is described as being in need of cleaning up and also called a dump. What you see on screen is an immaculate apartment that most would love to have. At least have your production designer read the script to see what the apartment is supposed to look like.2. Technical problems include shoddy blocking, continuity problems during cuts, crossing the imaginery 180 line, and amateurish camera work.3. Ok, the first two were picky things, but the biggest problem is this movie falls flat on it's face. Attempts at humor fail, characters are not believable, the story is not engaging.I never saw the stage production but my hunch is it MUST have been better than this movie. I suspect much was lost in the adaptation. This one is not even worth renting."
0,Disappointed,"Bought the book used. VERY, VERY disappointed. The package came not completely secured. And half the book, the pages at the top were stuck together. While going through to unstick the pages from each other, alot of them got ripped or completely ruined. BEWARE of used books!"
0,How the BLEEP could WB release this?!,"I waited TEN YEARS for these videos to be released on DVD, and now feel shafted. What were they thinking? The video is disgraceful for 2009. The 5.1 soundtrack is pathetic. These are landmark videos and should be treated with the respect this artist deserves. Instead we have lousy sound, awful picture 'quality' and an edited version of one of her most beloved songs. Who in the world ordained Warners to be my censor?!To edit art is fascism! May Warners burn in the flames of consumer damnation.If I could've rated it 0 stars I would have. Save your money folks and DEMAND a remaster!"
1,I'd Buy It If It Wasn't Called A Diablo,"I would probably buy this blade if it wasn't called a Diablo. I'm looking for a well-made, 10 inch diameter circular saw blade for cutting aluminum.Now, I understand the Freud company makes some very good products. But I haven't been able to talk myself into mounting an extremely sharp metal disk on my miter saw: that'll spin at around 3500 rpm, is red, is called a Diablo (that means Devil in Spanish-- I looked it up), and has a drawing of a devil on it.Yeah, call me supersitious."
1,Nice source book for math and physics,"This is a great book for wide variety of audiences -- students in high school to professionals (engineers and scientists) with many years of math training. If you are looking for rigorous derivations or theorem/proofs, this is not the book. But if you are looking for a handy source that you can go to everyday in your professional life, then this is the book. I commend the authors for designing an accessible book with cogent presentation and exceptional clarity."
1,Classic Short-Story and Faultless Adaptation,"""Brokeback Mountain"" deservedly won the Oscar (2006) for Best Writing, Adapted Screenplay. Larry McMurtry and Diana Ossana fleshed-out an illustrative and poignant script from the skeleton of Annie Proulx's short story. The ability to read and compare them side-by-side in one manuscript is an illuminating experience into the art of screen-writing."
0,Stay Away From Visioneer Scanners!,"I bought three of them last year-all different models. One for home, one for the office and one for a co-worker. We have hardly ever used any of them, but now all of them suffer the same problem: ""Unlock the scanner error"". They are unlocked!!!"
0,CHEAP,"This item has a nice concept, but it is poorly manufactured. My cd got stuck in it on the first use. The sound quality was very poor. It was the christmas gift that came right back to me on christmas day. I do not recommed this product for anyone. Thank god for amazon I was able to return it hassle free."
0,Leakage is so often,"It's very easy to go zero without usage after fully charged. Don't buy it, that's what I can say about it. I have sony and tenergy purchased with it at the same time a year ago, did not find such problems so far."
0,No Paean for Gaian,"What happened to Bishop? I loved her Black Jewels series, but this one seems like a regression. Was this her first novel? The characters are stiff or annoying, the plot too conceptual and obvious. The Back Jewels stories are creative, complex and interesting. She minimizes the boring black/bad vs. white/good split. For example, her twist of usually ""evil"" names used for places, and for characters who are often more good than bad. The Gaian story is simplistic and predictable. Skip it."
0,One of the worst songs in the history of music,"Every time this song would come on, i'd have to cover my ears and think of a better song. Other one hit wonders like Alannah Myles made great songs. these so-called musicians,(the baha men) have been forgotten. And who let the dogs out has faded to a dim memory"
0,Beyond Belief alright!,"This dvd is indeed beyond belief. Beyond belief that a great outfit such as Petra was allowed and enabled to produce such a failure. 1) Petra owes its fans a dvd set that has at least two dvds inside. 2) Petra owes its fans a concert that produces sound and camera work that is a million miles above the filth within this dvd. This dvd is only one in a million representative examples of why ""Christian music"" is made fun of and even disliked by Christians. Petra is not a valid witnessing tool. Those fans who say they were ""saved"" at a Petra show were simply seduced by something called the power of suggestion. Petra is cool but not GOD. Please do not buy this dvd and feel free to check for it in a dumpster at a ""Christian"" bookstore near you."
1,Professional Grade - Great buy!,I bought these clippers to use on puppy pit and miniature golden retriever. They are definitely easy to use and worthy of 5 stars! The best feature is the safety latch to protect busy fingers and paws when not in use. They are sharp and precise with a clean cut. Customer service was great with super fast ship to delivered time.
1,Exactly what I ordered,Thanks for the informative video that will help my children stay safe.The product was received shortly after I ordered it on Amazon. Good deal for the content contained in the Stranger Safety video.
0,I Want to Believe,"I appreciated Malika Oufkir's book very much. I have to wonder though, with the reader from Olympia, Washington, about some of the information Oufkir includes. It somehow seems disconnected at times. I also wonder why her father, well-connected and wealthy, jeapordized his family's lives with his attempted coup. The writing, as well, seems ""rough"" at times. I am very interested in Morocco and have traveled there. I do have great sympathy for Oufkir; I just wish the book were better written and more clear in the details. The poor woman, though, was probably in a state of constant shock due to the terrible conditions, and her recall probably IS uncertain at times."
0,Don't deal with Logitech,"I received these as a gift back in November 2007; he got them through TigerDirect. I used them daily at work, an office setting, until, like others, the left swivel attachment broke. As a temporary fix I taped them until it just got on my nerves. The packing slip said that the 1 year replacement was for AFTER the manufacturer's warranty was up; doing my research on Logitech I saw that that period was for 2 years. So I was golden, right? WRONG. I called Logitech and simply because I removed a STUPID little round sticker with a P and three numbers on it from the actual headphones, it voids the warranty. NOWHERE could I find anything telling me NOT to remove this stupid little sticker. And besides, how long would something like that really be expected to last, anyhow?!I'm really fed up with Logitech. Don't give them your money. (Indeed, TigerDirect cannot replace them until November 2009; called them to be sure)"
0,dust everywhere,Don't buy this from amazon.com. Sponge inside of the carseat cover became a dust when I first open the box and the dust was spreaded everywhere. Nobody wouldn't want to use this dirty stuff for newborns. Don't be fooled by its price.
1,Handy iPod battery backup,"Great product. I have taken this battery pack with me on long trips where plug-in energy sources may be hard to find, like airports and foreign hotels. This will recharge an iPod quickly, and you can listen as it charges."
0,Bad Experience,"1. Bed needed to be refilled every two hours because of unknown leak. I read and followed instructions carefully about keeping valves closed.2. The hand pump required a lot of effort and energy.3. I would have returned it, but I was on the road and didn't have the time or resources to do so."
1,Cute and perfect size,The size is perfect to make a 10 oz martini glass. It fits my hand perfectly and also looks great! The shipping was fast.
1,Refill cartridge,Haven't used them yet but are exactly like the one that is in my pur faucet water filter. Were a lot cheaper than buying them in a store.
0,Leave them alone,Man the other peeps on this page is harsh shaniqua is a sweet song.Most of the other songs is wack dough
0,Photo misleading,I returned this product simply because I assumed it contained the protection of the physical body as well but it was just the bottom part. It was sturdy but wasn't what I assumed it was.
1,the battle of the river platte. one of best warship movies,"For a warship collector to see these ships in there 1950's appearance was exciting. Could not be done as well with models or computer graphics. I saw the film when I was young,and at the time I enjoyed it,but could not fully appreciate it."
1,Voldyne Volumetric Incentive Spirometer,I needed an incentive Spirometer and so looked atseveral that Amazon carries. The one I chose from its picture fits my needs exactly and is easy to hold and use.
1,A Great Album From A Great Band,"KoRn has done it again, and other bands should take NOTE.The CD may sound the same as the rest of their stuff, but why change something that isn't broken, tracks like ALIVE, HERE IT COMES AGAIN, BREAK SOME OFF and RIGHT NOW are the heart of this disc.This is a CD that i would take with me if i could only have 5 disc on a island"
0,Poor Quality,Product lasted less than 24 hours and rubber suction cup ripped causing bracket to come loose and no longer function. This occurred while it was mounted to the windshield. I suppose I got what I paid for.
1,Complete Reference Material,"This book goes into every aspect of brewing, giving fantastic reference charts for hops, yeasts, beer styles, grains, carbonation, etc. I refer to this book every time I brew. This is not some lame homebrewing recipe book, that are a dime a dozen. This is the only book I use over and over-- the rest of my books gather dust on the shelf."
0,It did not work,"Most likely the product works in other circumstances, but for sure not here in Manhattan. Pigeons continued to come undisturbed on my balcony...most likely they have no idea what an owl is!! I had to buy pigeon spikes and eventually that worked.However I have no complaint about the vendor and Amazon service, excellent."
0,"""Home Video"" is a misleading title for this book.","Incredibly, he completely avoids AC3, Dolby Digital, DTS, component video, and similar areas I hoped to learn about. The rest of the book was either overly technical or uselessly vague. This author appears to know little about home theater and a lot about ham radio. It's a poor quality book, and I wouldn't expect this from McGraw-Hill."
1,Good product,I really like this protein shake. I mix it with fat free milk and it tastes great. I usually mix it in a bottle and it leaves some chunks on the bottom. I guess it would be better to mix in a mixer.
1,MAXIMUM VIOLENCE!,"The latest offering from Nothingface, sure lives up to its name! The lyrics are mind blowing, attention grabbing, and and beutiful! The riffs are enough to insite violence in any mosh pit. I gave this album 4 stars and not five for 2 reasons. 4 and a half were not abailble, and I believe that their previous album was a little better. But all in all, Nothingface has put out one of the most brutal, and execntly crafted albums of the past year."
0,Not a documentary. Just readings from the book.,"I thought it would be a documentary, but it was just people reading quotes in front of an audience. Interesting stuff but hard to watch the whole thing. Guess I should have taken the title of the DVD a little more literally! Lol. THAT birthday gift was a flop! :("
0,Violent! too much!!!,"There is nothing special about this book! All the entire thing of dragon ball z is about is violence! I, as a kid my self, think it is far too violent! If you get this book for anyone, do not get it for young readers. It is a very bad example! And a total waste of money!"
1,Good Value and Gets the Job Done!,"I was introduced to suspension training at my gym where I used a more expensive brand. I liked the concept and the portability of this type of workout system. Having researched the reviews at Amazon, I learned about the Jungle Gym and decided, for the price - almost 2/3's less than the other brand, I couldn't go wrong if I didn't like it or I wasn't motivated to go it alone at home. Well, I was quite satisfied with the value. It's very basic - straps, handles and buckles but...it gets the job done! The buckles are easy to use making the strap lengths easy to adjust. I also watched some of the YouTube video's to get more exercise ideas. I am quite satisfied and will bring it with me when I travel. (It would have been nice if it had come with a stuff bag to store it but that's easy enough to buy.)"
0,Was I watching the same movie?,"I see that other people really loved this movie, but I thought it was terrible. I am a sucker for tear jerker movies and also for Christmas movies, but seriously, Linda Hamilton's character in this movie was so annoying. She had no common sense and made so many stupid mistakes to make her situation worse. Linda Hamilton did a terrible acting job, with her sighs and pitiful looks. I kept yelling at the t v, c'mon lady get it together. I only toughed it out to see if she wold make it. But, not very enjoyable."
1,Does a perfect job.,I have transferred hours of my analog camcorder tapes using the DAC-200. It is easy to use and does a very accurate job. Both video and audio come out like the original and perhaps even better once it is put on a DVD. I am highly pleased with this product. (The 200 has one additional feature to the 100. But I don't think it makes a difference.)
1,ooooooooowwww,"This Thing Is HOT!IT IS OFF DA HOOK!I got this thing for christmas and this thing is awesome!It has everything u need in a cd player and then some. This is this the best sounding cd player for its price. Ive tried many other ones.It plays Cd-R/Rw. Also although they say it has 45-Second esp, it actually has 45! It never skips. Also this cd player is the best looking one for its price range. It has a clear blue body. Also its heat resistant. It has about 18 hours of battery life if u play it with alotta bass and volume, but can have over 20+ hours.It has a line out and all kinds of other features. It not only has one level of bass boost but 2!(yes thats right....it has TWO!) It has unbelievable bass. I have no cons about this cd player other than the cheap headphone but hey, do any come with great one?Trust me this is a GREAT buy."
1,"Works good but,","I bought these for my FoodSaver brand sealer just because they are far cheaper than the FS brand. These work very good, and have the diamond texture on both sides and make it feel a little more heavy duty. My only issue with them is they like to stay curled. The FS brand ones didn't stay too curled off the roll, but these ones want to roll right back up and it makes for a pain when you're trying to make the bottom of the bag seal. But don't let that stop you from getting them, especially for the price. Just make sure you have the bag pressed flat when making the initial seal and you'll do great!"
0,"""Ripped"" off","We bought this item for a BMX Qualifier race. We went to put the first leg on the ground and the seam totally ripped!! We were so disappointed! DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM!!! Easy Ups are a much better way to go and the other review was absolutely correct....this Eddie Bauer item is really flimsy!! If youdon't anchor the whole thing down....away it goes!!! For the money it's a total rip-off!! I wouldn't have even given this one star, but I didn't have a choice.MichelleTitusville, PA"
0,Not a same as Canon,"I bought these batteries a couple of months ago. They seemed fine for a few weeks, but now they don't hold a charge at all. The Canon batteries are a lot more expensive, but I think I'll stick with those next time."
1,Live Points,"Cheaper than getting it direct on the Xbox. Can't beat that! As long as there are good albums like Dr.Feelgood available for RB2, I'll be buying more points."
1,fun and great movie,"This movie expains what is a bear that all time that do know what people what see how they can be loved to everyone.WOOF Love, DJBEARWOOF"
0,On and on and on...,"After enjoying ""The Jane Austen Book Club"", I looked forward to another novel by this author. The story line never seemed to gather momentum and I persevered but was very disappointed. The characters meandered in and out of each other's lives, but Fowler wove a hazy and foggy plot, not unlike the weather in San Francisco."
0,"Great Game, Bad Programming","This game is a worthy mention among RPG gamers but unfortunately, this port by this company, Revival did a terrible job. I bought this game thinking that I could overcome any poor programming that the guy before complained about because I have some skill in computer program troubleshooting. I worked on it for hours and got it to only work occasionally for short periods of time. It seems that this game, despite its claims, does not support Windows XP. There are forums filled with people complaining about this game and ideas on how to make it work. In short, unless you are a computer programmer by trade with a lot of patience and free time, avoid this version on the game."
1,"Great, except for the clamps","This is a great toy for keeping my 11-month-old son entertained in the car. He likes to spin the wheel, honk the horn, play the music, accelerate and decelerate, and all the things he does make little sounds and lights. But no matter how I attach this to his car seat (he has a Britax roundabout), it will not stay on for long. Eventually he pulls on it enough that the clamps come loose and it falls down, then he tosses it off to the side, gets bored, and fusses. I think the clamps are simply not good for attaching to a fabric-covered object, like the side of a car seat. It seems like a design flaw. Too bad, because I searched everywhere for something entertaining enough for long car rides, and I thought this was it. I am still trying to figure out ways to jerry-rig it to the seat- haven't given up yet!!"
1,Awesome!!!!,"It's a fun movie,it has action and everything we love about the Fast and Furious series!! Get this movie it's not to be missed!!"
0,Bugs,The title is deceptive. It is a children's book with very large pictures of very few insects. I wanted a book with more info than it contains.
1,A talented poet and loving human being,"Experiencing Sahara's book is a gift you give to yourself. It's also a gentle yet strong reminder that we each have the power to create our own unique world, and that our view of the world depends on how we view ourselves. Sahara has clearly learned that love awakens one's senses and spirit. Her keen ability to express those feelings through simple words and intricate illustrations will warm the hearts and stimulate creative minds of both young and old. Her mature wisdom and beautiful view of the world has obviously been stronly influenced by the loving support, nurturing, and artistic photographic skills of her mother. We congratulate mother and daughter, both of whom are great role models. We look forward to purchasing Sahara's next book and have reserved a spot for her in The Kids Hall of Fame."
1,"PMS? Nope, it's ""WAR""!","I gotta tell you, I loved this story!!! I giggled throughout this entire book at the group of ladies calling themselves ""WAR"" -- What a fun book! I will be on the lookout for more wonderful stories by this fun writer! Bravo New Writer, Christy French!"
0,Don't waste your time reading this one,"I agree with the review that said this was ""juvenile writing"". Very predictable. Too many ""proverbial sayings"" (doesn't she have anything original to say ??). First Dee Davis book I ever read, and I don't see anything that makes me want to read another one."
1,Good old Rock,I bought this album in the mid 70's and loved it then. still love it. It is one of bob's best albums. it is a great live album. If you like Bob Seger then this is a must have.
0,One of the ten worst sci-fi books ever written,"I think this is the first time i've actually been so disgusted with a book that I've read that I threw it across the room. The book is a pastiche of regurgitated generic aliens, a feline race ala Niven, the generice Bug race ala Aliens and Heinlein. It tries to pass itself off as a hard sci-fi book but comes across as a novel written purely to satisfy an Editorial obgligation. I understand that there is a large market for trashy underwritten operatic sci-fi. That's why Star Trek and Star Wars novels sell so well. I coulld in good conscience refer this generic sci-fi to my worst enemy. It's the Crown of Swords ( Robert Jordan ) of Sci-Fi."
1,Good Reliability,Have been using this piece for over two years now in a parking garage mechanical closet and have had 0 issues.
0,Stop -- put your card away! It's not worth it,"Not only is this camera awfull -- it's not even suitable for kids, unless as a parent you enjoy tearing your hair out while you try and fix serial port conflicts so that the little ones can enjoy a two inch square photo with less than 72 pixels per inch. I will probably never buy another polaroid again based on my experience with this one."
0,If i could it this book 0 stars I would.,"I am quite tired of the kind of old concepts that are spread around in this book. This is not done out of love but out of total blindness. Following what is written in this book will not lead to freedom but more misery and who needs that? Life is hard enough as it is without someone who is gay being forced to hate themselves, to hate who they are all because of a book that was written thousands of years ago and has been passed down to so many hands it's not even the same book. Open your eyes. It is nearly the year 2000. We don't need fear of this sort in the next century."
0,NOT WORTH,"Sony TRV 310 is not worth for 999.99. The accessories are very expensive, with out accessories you can not enjoy with this camcorder.I do not recoment this product to other people."
0,It Doesn't Deserve the Medal,"""Criss Cross"" by Lynne Rae Perkins is somewhat of a sequel to her debut novel, ""All Alone in the Universe."" Criss Cross is about kids living in the 70's who are fourteen. It's just about them living there lives, going through things every normal teen goes through. The problem with Criss Cross is that it doesn't go anywhere, just kinda wanders around on the surface of plotlines. When it does go a little deeper, it pulls itself up out onto the surface, and the storylines are forgotten within the next few chapters. The book is alright, but it didn't deserve the Newbery Medal, which should of went to ""Day of Tears."" If you want to read something by Mrs. Perkins, read ""All Alone in the Universe"" which is better and has a point."
1,good movie,"I saw this a few years ago, and it is really thought provoking, which is rare in movies nowdays. It makes you wonder how easy it could be to create a dictatorship in which the few own the powerful, especially since nowdays the media will participate because they care more about ratings than reporting. my only complaint was the length, although that is due to my short attention span"
1,Cozy companion for baby!,"This floppy lion is a nice, huggable pal for baby to snuggle with. It even has a teether tail. When you squeeze its nose, it ""baby"" talks, teaching cause and effect. The only thing I did not care for was the scent. It's supposed to smell like oranges, but the odor is just too artificial and strong, although it does go away afer a while."
1,Very good chairs.,"I would have given them 5 stars, but I hardly give anything 5 stars. The color of these chairs is a bit lighter than my table, but they still look good. Very sturdy and it was great not having to put them together. They arrived in 2-3 days and were ready to use out of the box. I bought a set of 2 more right after I received the first two. Great deal!"
1,Fantastic Book to Grow Your Business!,This book has great insight into success with any business. It has definitely changed my business in a positive way and has increased my sales just by implementing a few principles.
0,This is,one of the stupidest moves I ever wasted my money on. Althought I know there are truly some really sick people out there. I wouldn't recomend this movie to anyone...but to each his own.
0,Better Pasta Not So Good!,"My mom bought me this set when I first moved into my apartment. I do not recommend using this set.Here were my 2 biggest problems:1.) The dye from both pots stained my countertop. Can only be removed with soap and hot water. By the way, I have the red colored set.2.) Eventually the bottom inside (non-stick portion) of the smaller pot chipped away and I had chunks of black plastic in my pasta. Had to discard my meal and the pot.The only positive: the water does heat rather quickly. Unfortunately you are not supposed to put your stovetop heat on too high. What's the point!"
1,Feet Blisters,"I was looking for a product to protect blisters on my feet. I play flag football every week and needed something to protect my feet from blistering up each week. Unfortunately this product just falls off the skin when I played. I'm sure the product works fine for walking or something less strenuous, but for active sports and for feet blisters it will end up coming off. Turns out that using simple sports tape was my best protection cause i can cover a large area on my foot and it will not move."
0,Boring!!!,"This was a very disappointing purchase. I nearly fell asleep watching it. The host talks in monotone. There's relaxation music in the back ground. Overall, don't waste your money."
1,had to finish it...,"From the first page, I was hooked. Kristen Heitzmann always does a great job of weaving a tale that includes mystery/suspense, wit, romance, and faith. I liked all the characters a lot, and felt they were all well-developed, including the supporting roles. I would absolutely recommend this book to others. I couldn't wait to find out what happened, yet I didn't want it to end. In a nutshell: well-written, good clean romance, very amusing writing at times, and perfect ending. Still wasn't quite as great as Heitzmann's Edge of Recall, but close. Happy reading!"
0,Don't mess with a classic.,"Halloween directed and written and directed by Rob Zombie (of all people!) is a terrible remake of the 1978 classic. It's a new take on Halloween, the characters have more of a back story and jeez there's a lot of blood and nudity in this one, this film doesn't work at all. The dialogue is cheesy and lame as hell, Zombie isn't a literary god not even a little. The acting is embarrassing, I can't believe Zombie couldn't find any decent actors and of course he put his real-life wife in this as Michael Myers mother, she plays a stripper! Thank god I have the original to fall back on, this remake was a complete waste of time!"
0,Terribly disappointed,"I was unable to watch the movie because I was sent one that cannot be watched in the United States.It has a PAL insignia on it. I was in touch the seller and they want me to send it back, but it would cost more to return it than the movie itself.I asked the seller to mail me the packaging and label so I could return it, but that is not their practice. I am deeply disappointed and it will be my last purchase from this seller."
1,making the unobtainable readable,"Another fascinating book by Bill Bryson, the champion of turning the most extraordinary (and often unreachable) subjects into readable, engaging, addictive, and mind-blowing books. Here, he tackles the small subject of the history of our little blue planet, from the great cosmos to the tiniest atoms, from the creation of the universe to our species' first steps. Bryson's prose is chock full of wonder and appreciation and simple entertainment at the awesome wonders of our world. Most impressively, he manages to embrace that universal truth of science: the more we understand, the less we know. And that is also the beauty and awe of science, of all that goes into our magnificent world. It is an amazing feat that we are here, that anything is here, and we are all made of the same stuff and come from the same stuff. We should not only appreciate that to its fullest, but we should do everything in our power to take care of it. Grade: A+"
0,"Excellent story, Extremely poor edition by this publisher","The G.A. Henty story was excellent but this edition by Quiet Publishing was horrible. The book wasn't rectangular but wrongly cut on an angle and all the text was crooked inside. The binding was so poor the book fell apart as we were reading it. Order this book, just not from Quiet Publishing."
1,"The Caress Moisturizing Body Bar, Peach, is very ...","The Caress Moisturizing Body Bar, Peach, is very pleasant smelling and works into a very good lather. My skin is very dry and this product seemed to help with that somewhat. It's nowhere near as dry as what it was. I really did like it and I'd definitely recommend this to others."
0,This is NOT the Moroder soundtrack!!,"The music Giorgio Moroder came up with for his soundtrack to the classic ""Metropolis"" was unbelievable and actually enhanced portions of Fritz Lang's masterpiece. But this ""offical"" soundtrack contains ALL butchered versions of the great music found in the movie. Why couldn't they have just inserted what we heard in the film onto the soundtrack instead of revising (for the MUCH MUCH worse) all the songs? The most disappointing track is when Pat Benatar's incredibly moving vocals in the film are destroyed and replaced with a lame effort here. Moroder's film versions of these songs introduced me to deep feelings of romantic love I'd never experienced, and this ""official"" soundtrack doesn't even match the emotional level of a cheesy chick flick. If you like Giorgio Moroder, do what I did and record the audio off the DVD or video of this film onto a tape or CD... do NOT listen to this soundtrack."
1,Critics didnt like it??,"What did they want from another movie in this franchise. Albeit the fact that the reunion comes at a wier time and is explained away in a one liner and we all are suppose to buy inyo it the movie only had 90minutes to catch you up on your old favorite characters. It was innapropriate, raunchy, full of crude humor, and had the same feel this movie is famous for. Would it be nice to spend time eith the gang on a more mature level, sure. However, that wouldnt be an American Pie movie, it would be some melodramtic bore."
0,Bad experience on install and with tech support,"I bought because of price and description. I am running a WIN7 64-bit system. I followed the install instructions but it would not install. I called tech support. They had me remove the modem hardware and reinstall. Now I get 9 drivers listed in the device manager. The technicain gave me a case number and said someone would call me within 24 hours. After 36 hours, I called again. I was then told they were very busy and they would return my call in 10 minutes. After 2 hours I called again. I was again told they were very busy and they would definitely return my call within 10 minutes. It is now the next day and no call. Support comes out of Southern India and is available 24/7 for the U.S. and Canada. Stay away from Trendnet - questionable product and horrific support. Documentation is marginal at best."
0,Conair GS4 Fabric Steamer,"I am really disappointed with this product. I gave it a couple of tries and finally gave up. The hose is too short to reach things like hanging drapes, it sputters water onto the clothing. If I use the over the door hanger, I risk warping the wood of the door over time with the steam, somthing I'm not willing to do, so a portable clothes hanger would be of more use. I'm returning this today and looking for a hand held model that will do what I want it to."
0,"Not durable, buy at your own risk","I bought this printer about 7 months ago. I was satisfied with it's quality and speed. A bit noisy but okay. The biggest problem was the costly ink, but since I didn't really print much, this is still okay.Now the REAL problem, it spitted out some plastic parts today and stopped working anymore. The warranty period is just 90 days, and instead of paying for the repair, you can pay the same amount for another new printer.You get the idea. Buy at your own risk."
0,Defective product.,"I purchased this product despite several reviews warning against doing so. Reviews said things like, ""cartridges print fine for 3-4 sheets, and then the printer no longer recognizes it and fails to print"" or, ""print quality is OK, but is unacceptable if you're printing a resume or other important document."" Unfortunately, I also encountered both of these scenarios, and now the print cartridges are boxed up and ready to get sent back to wherever they came. I'll be spending a little more money and purchasing a better product next time. Don't waste your money on these cartridges, and don't support a business who delivers such a sub-standard product."
0,Not a very good telling of the tale.,"Most of the story herein assembled could certainly be more satisfyingly gleaned from Shakespeare's Richard III or More's own account, on whom she relies heavily. At the very least, I recommed following the genealogical chart provided in Antonia Fraser's ""The Lives of the Kings and Queens of England"", not the one included in this book. It is so glaringly flawed it made me crazy. This book is not for a novice on the subject."
1,In Harms Way,"Bought this movie for a friend who likes the old action movies, he was very happy and watched it as soon as he got it in his hands...""nothing like those old classics"" he said! This one in particular was 'super', as he puts it, because the Mega actors John Wayne and Kirk Douglas and George Kennedy starred in it. Recommends it to anyone who likes action, war etc...films."
0,If you like WEP you are in luck - with WPA - stay away!,"This thing is great with WEP but flaps when you enable WPA with a pre-shared secret. I purchased this in the hope of connecting my Tivo to my WLAN since it doesn't support WPA at all! It was an expensive mistake. Everytime I want to update Tivo, I have to power cycle the device. It works for a bit then drops and reconnects. I have used it with a D-Link and with a Checkpoint Safe@Office with the same results. If you use WPA, don't buy it."
1,"Foreigner fans, never mind the bad reviews, get this DVD","Most of you people should probably get a new tv, dvd player and sound system.... this DVD is very enjoyable !!! There are no problems with the audio or the video on this DVD. Yes some of the stuff might be a bit cheezy, but that's how dvd's from the early 90's look like. I think the worst thing on this DVD is the stage design. But nothing we can do about that.....And to the person who collects and owns 35 DVD's...well you're not in a position to criticize any DVD. When you get to the major leagues of collecting DVD's and have at least 500 and up, you can comment !!! What a joke this is !!!"
1,Hard to find 12 inches,Great CD with Carrie Lucas great Disco Songs in full lengh versions. Good add up for my collection.
0,My Dog HATES this pill.,"I spent $25 on these. They worked, I think. My dog was peeing in her sleep on a nightly basis. 3 days after I started administering these pills, they worked. For a few days, and now she is peeing again on about the 7th day. The biggest problem aside from I'm not sure if they are a good solution, is trying to get these pills into my dog. She finds them in everything. I have researched and tried every method out there (hiding it in cheese, meat, a hotdog, making it powder and putting it in her food, or mixing it into yogurt, or goat milk. She has become suspect of everything I give her to eat, and I think its starting to create a bad habit of not eating when I feed her. I have had to resort to jamming it down her throat, and trust me, doing this twice a day for the rest of her life, really sucks. It's difficult, and unpleasant for both of us. I wake up, and I dread having to give her, her first pill of the day. I'm going to try Leaks No More.~Allen"
0,This book stinks,"This book was written by the leading beauty expert in the Sally Beauty Supply company and is meant for nothing more than ""troubleshooting"" for common beauty problems and helping the Sally's customer find exact brand name products (that are only available through Sally stores) to help ""solve"" the particular problem. My advise? Either go into a Sally's store or your hair stylist's salon and ""Ask The Experts""."
1,Fun book,This was a selection for my book club. I actually really enjoyed the book. After reading the book I went to the local institute of art and checked out some of the mentioned painting.
1,Phantom Stallion #6,"An amazing story, but not my favorite. Very good intro. Perfect for nature-lovers all over the world. A personal recommendation. I enjoyed reading this book. Very suspenseful but an amazing ending. I strongly suggest you pick this book up on your way through!"
1,A concise view of Plath in her time,"This book is an excellent look at what Plath wrote, her beginnings as a writer, the climates that she worked in and how her relations with her mother and her husband helped to shape her writing. While I would have liked to see more of how Plath's favorite authors influenced her, there is enough new material (letter and journal excerpts, as well as the author's observations) to make it a worthwhile addition to the ever-growing pile of books on the legendary Sylvia Plath. A good study for beginners and scholars alike."
1,Devotional for years,"My Utmost for His Highest is a classic devotional. In the newest version it is easier reading than ever. You will have no trouble using this devotional not just one time but for many years. Like the Bible itself, each new reading brings another aspect of what it means to truly try to live for God."
1,CELTIC WOMAN-A NEW JOURNEY,"I really enjoy it and the songs that are on it. I was really expecting it to have ORINOCO FLOW on it, but it was not."
1,Like a hot knife through buttah!,"I've been shaving my own head for ten years now...and prior to this item, I've been using cheap Wahl clippers - the kind you can pick up at Target/Sears/etc.Anyway, The Oster Fast Feed just blazed through my thick hair without a hiccup. I was amazed. I haven't experience such haircutting nirvana since my hair was lopped off for Basic Training at Fort Sill in the summer of 1995.These clippers are definitely worth it."
0,Not About Dreams!,"This book is not about dreams, so if you want to know about dreams, you should get ""The Dream Book"" instead. I don't understand this book."
0,WORTH THE PRICE,The headset seems to have a lot of static sounds in the backround issues.Don't conform to ear or around ear very easily or securely. Always feels as if it is going to fall off your ear.Reason being the price was very inexpensive. If you can deal with the above issues and not be bothered by them then this item is for you.
1,total chick flick,"Husband thought it was too much for him. Hence I term it a chick flick. Kids loved it and it is suitable for children. I thought it was okay. It had moments that made you feel love, happiness, sadness. Quirky little number."
0,Ugh... This is going no where,"I have the 70-069 in two weeks and this book is driving me insane. There are typos, as well as wrong answers on the cd. The exercises rarely work typed in the way the book has them. You'll need to figure out most of the debugging yourself. Bad book, don't buy it."
1,Hot Damn!,"Old Al is just timeless. Brings back the happy memories of high school when this scared white girl was bused to Northside High. His music helped bridge that gap. Listening to Al still makes me want to sing and dance and helps uplift me even on my gloomiest days. His upbeat music had a spirtual essence, even then. My husband likes him now and he never was a fan before. Great CD and great price!"
0,Unrealistic,"This may be a decent read for someone newly introduced to investing, but for anyone with any sense about finance looking to learn trading strategies that are both practical and successful, this book is a waste of time. I think the author lives in a fairly tale world."
1,Astonishing!,"I have had this CD now for a year.....every time I go on a long trip, I'd listen to it....it just makes a ride nice and smooth. Bocelli is simply ""music to your ears."" you never get tired,even after listening to it 5-10 times in a roll."
0,Useless,"I bought one of these things too. It looked like it would be perfect for my use. But the thing was impossible to put together. The wooden dowels were much larger than the holes that they supposedly fit into, and it was so unstable that putting more than a few pegs in was near impossible. I returned it and I'm sure they had to dump it due to the damage I had to cause just trying to put it together."
0,Simon's a fraud,"Simon is also known as Peter Levenda, and writes other slightly paranoid books with that name, has a website where research is done by linking names and events together and calling the distance between the two ""part of the conspiracy"".The man sees ghosts.Google ""Alan Cabal and THE DOOM THAT CAME TO CHELSEA"" and you'll get the honest story.Boo. Hiss."
1,"Excellent, a guide to truth in relationship roles","This book is awesome...a real eye opener, it will make you take a hard look at yourself. I think it is ideally for both men and women...we are all dealing with a form of male energy within ourselves, and it will guide you to the truth of roles that I think all are searching for..."
1,Textbook review: Fundamentals of Management,"Here is another review for another one of my classes, Principles of Business Management. The book is a lot easier to follow than the book I recently reviewed; ""Marketing: Connecting with Customers."" In addition to more fluent material, the end of each chapter has questions to help prepare the student for exams, whereas the marketing book does not. Another pro to the book is that the material covered is up-to-date, accurate, and very useful in today's management situations. 20 years ago, you couldn't really sit down and read/study a book to become a better manager, whereas today it is made possible to do so. Figures, charts, graphs, and examples are also very useful and helpful in studying for exams. Cons about the book is that a few activities or interactive CD-ROM would have made the material more enjoyable to learn about. Overall rating, 4 stars."
1,"Soundtrack - Movie ""FM""","First recorded the soundtrack from an LP to Cassette, in 1979, while stationed in Germany. Old tape was just getting worn out and had a lot of noise. New CD and new technology just made the music come to life, better than the crackling noise of LP. My wife was listening to the old tape and asked me to see if I could find it in CD format. Her birthday was approaching and I immediately thought of Borders, which in turn directed me to Amazon. I'm glad you folks had it in stock, for an extremely fair price! Thanks Montie Arkel, Lawton, Oklahoma"
1,Good treats for good dogs,"I never thought I'd be baking treats for my dog, but now that I know how easy it is I won't go back to the store-bought variety! The dough is alot easier to work with than cookie dough, and its okay (even preferable) if the treats come out crunchy!"
1,Controversial arguments,"As an evangelical christian I do not worship or pay any particular respect to medals, relics or even paintings of any kind, but the scientifical arguments in favor of the resurrection of Christ in this documentary are worth to be studied by Pastors and theologians. If you are not involved in the academic christian field I have to warn you not to view this DVD alone but in the company of your pastor or the person encharged of your discipleship. We must defend the resurrection of Christ at all cost from the agnostic, communist, socialist and scientifical arguments of today."
0,Company should be banned,"Appears I have suffered the same fate as the other customers. Product was listed as ""in stock"" and ""available"" when I ordered. However, a week after ordering, I received an email which states my order is cancelled with no explanation.Companies that have a habit of treating customers and orders in this fashion should be banned from selling on Amazon."
1,Versatile!,"I bought two of the EZ adjust bed rail for my aging father. They have been very helpful. We keep one fully extended and the other one shorter. My father can get out of bed on the shorter side and has not fallen out of bed since. The pockets are great to keep remotes, eye glasses, etc. I just came from visiting my father and saw the rails for the fist time and was impressed with their looks, versatility and sturdiness."
0,"Great concept, horrible execution.....","I bought this set immediately after it was released and was apalled at what I had bought. While the concept of having every issue on disc was a great idea, the use of JPEG images for the data instead of PDF was completely botched.Tech support, back in 1996, said they could have used less compression on the images of the pages, but they would have had to use even more than the 30+ CDs they had in the set and they decided that merely HAVING every issue would make up for any shortcomings in presentation.The end result: a [very costly] set of 30 CDs I hardly ever use and it's a shame as I really wanted to sit back and enjoy as many issues as I could but the text, while mostly legible, is a chore to read.Spend your money elsewhere or go to the library!"
1,Good For Peace of Mind,"This book doesn't really have a lot of information, but it performed an important function - confirming that there aren't very many groom-specific duties, and that I hadn't overlooked anything.I would recommend buying this for the peace of mind."
1,cute,this was a cute family movie like dumbo jungle book and i know its after Walt Disney the aristocats
0,EEEEEEEEEWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,"WHAT AN UGLY YASMIN.I AM A HUGE BRATZ FAN,BUT I CAN UNDERSTAD WHAT HAPPEND TO THE MIDNIGHT DANCE COLLECTION.ALL OF THEM ARE UGLY.TO GET A BEAUTIFUL YASMIN DOLL.GET THE BRATZ ROCK ANGELZ DOLL INSTED OR ANOTHER YASMIN DOLL.PRETTY IN PUNK IS LAME TOO."
1,Absolutly Creative,"I own all of Rufus' cds, and when I saw this one, I had to have it, I thought I owned all of his cds, but nope, low and behold this is one I was missing. I didn't even listen to it, I just bought it and waited for arrival. The cd is so creative, I really like how in each of his cds, he has a different mood and sound. He keeps it quite interesting for his listeners. I love that song ""Instant Pleasure"". You must listen to it. Its such a feel good song when you are in a bad mood, the song and Rufus' voice make things better!"
0,These types of toys,"My son wanted a motion type toy for his room and they break very easily, Not happy with this item."
0,A poorly researched and written rant,"My husband and I both read this book together. I was appalled at the poor research compiled by Ms. Robins, and amazed at how badly the book read. It was not informative, it was argumentative. The topics would start out in an informed manner, but then quickly collapse into either a rant about breastfeeding, or misinformation, or more frightening, incorrect information. My mild mannered husband was moved to shouting at the idiocity of her '38 reasons' since the vast majority of them put the mother's wants before the needs of the child. And that's selfish.Don't waste your money on this book, that's my suggestion."
0,Self-Centered,"This book was not about how to make it by in America on an average wage, it was about how much the writer could inflate her ego. All the writer did was talk about herself and give social commentary (misguided at that). She goes into excrutiating detail about what she eats, what she packs, etc. Actually, in my viewpoint, Ms. Ehrenreich is making money on the backs of the poor with this book, exactly what she is disgusted about in the corporate world. I do not recommend this book unless you want to read a book that will completely agitate you."
1,Nice book,"This book, like many positive thinking books had many good points. Like many guru-types, sometimes I felt a little uncomfortable with some of his non-traditional ""religious"" views, but it was interesting."
1,just as fascinating as reading one of Baker's own books. . .,What a great read. This book truly let's you into the psyche of Baker. Reads sort of like a bio in many ways. Definetly a must read for Baker fans.
0,Does not fit receiver as advertised,"The advert says the product is compatible with 1-1/4"" and 2"" receivers. That is not true. It works only with a 2"" receiver. Unfortunately I do not have that. In addition the box itself has several chips in the coating. All in all a very disappointing experience. Not recommended."
1,nice harmonica !,Very nice instrument ! fun to play ! sounds great ! this harmonica costs more than the usual 5-10 dollar harmonicas but you can tell that it sounds different. more quality. easy to bend
1,Comfy!!!,"I have leg and back problems and cannot wear a true flat or a high heel. These sandals have a slight heel and a comfortable fit. I have been wearing them for a few years now, and have not been able to find anything comparable. Sad thing is is that Aerosoles has discontinued this particular style so I am not sure what I will do in the future. Buy them while you can."
0,Didn't last 6 months..,"*Edited from original review*So originally I rated this coffee maker 5 stars and had a great review about how I loved the cup and lid, how fast this makes coffee, etc etc. Then after not even 6 months of daily use it started giving me problems. It won't ever brew all of the water I put in the reservoir- only a portion of it. Then I have to go back and press the start button down again and it brews a little more, then I do it again, etc. until I finally have a full cup of coffee. I've tried cleaning it, running some vinegar/water through, etc- but it still won't brew a full cup in one cycle. I'm not heartbroken since it was so inexpensive, but I still expected it to last at least a year! I've since ordered a french press to try something different :)"
1,Good sturdy post,"I'm satisfied with the size and sturdiness of this post, but it would be better if it didn't have carpet halfway up the post. I think my cat would enjoy it more if it was made entirely of the sisal rope. My ragdoll kitten likes to stretch and scratch, but the carpet is too smooth to really sink his claws into.So he usually scratches at the bottom where the rope is. He loves to scurry up this post and sit at the top."
1,Excellent introduction to UML and the use of patterns.,One of the best hands-on books I've ever read. Lucid explanations of the use of patterns in OOAD along with an excellent introduction to UML are the highlights of the book. Of particular value are the detailed examples of how to do the actual work. Highly recommended.

1,Principle of Moments,"I loved this album on vinyl, back in the 80's. I bought it lately on CD. It holds up quite well as time goes by. ""In The Mood"" and ""Big Log"" are my favorites, but I like the whole album very much. Live versions of ""In The Mood"", ""Thru With The Two Step"", ""Lively Up Yourself"", and a studio version of ""Turnaround"" are the Bonus Tracks. If your not familiar with it, check it out. It's good stuff!!"
1,blind man's bluff,"A very good account of the dangers and adventures of the men in the submarine services.I particularly appreciated it, as my brother was in that service, and until now never shared much of his evperiences. I think it was not allowed."
1,Great for bedtime reading,"I started reading this to my young boys at night when it's time for bed. I remember enjoying it as a kid the same way. It's a wonderful story with animals so it's easy to get them hooked.It takes one or two chapters to get them involved but once they know the rat and the mole they can't help but be eager to know what they are going to be doing next.One thing you need to be aware of is that the language is challenging for children so you need to be able to read and adjust the content on the fly. It's written in an old style with words and phrases kids won't understand. This will keep you on your toes as well.I have the kindle edition which is not as fine as having the real book with better pictures. However the kindle makes it easy to read without having the lights on so sleep comes faster!In a world of very quick, often simplified stories it's a pleasure to watch my kids enjoy a charming and rich story well told so they can use their imaginations."
0,"Cool idea but not so practical as a stapler, very disappointing","I ordered this item from thinkgeek to use at work. I work in immigration and the government hates staples! Unfortunately, they also do not appreciate the big hole this stapler leaves on the paper. And I do not like that it does not work most of the time. And if the paper does not get tucked in properly then you are just left with a hole in your paper and need to staple it anyway. It is a cool idea but does not really serve any purpose. I cannot use it at work even for my own internal papers because it does not staple more than three pages and often doesn't work even for 3 pages. I don't have the time to play around with this thing so I requested to return it, was told to keep it and got a gift certificate for the cost. It is pretty disappointing as I was very excited about the idea of this. I cannot recommend it for practical use but its a cool concept and conversation starter."
0,Limited use,"I don't think this short book is good at all. Like the reader below, I found the information in the book to outdated. While the authors may wish to alert people on the risk of SARS, it's often inappropriate to rush out such a kind of book so soon, in particular when our knowledge of the disease is advancing by the day. Because of this, I don't think the book can be recommended."
0,Disappointed,I bought this for my daughter as a stocking stuffer. The cord doesn't fit. I think I can make it fit with a little help from my dremel.
1,This 'Thing' is good!,"There's not much good horror/thriller films today but I find this 'Thing' good for my collection. I haven't seen the original 'Thing' but this movie gives you an idea what's with the original.I say this is just good because there was too much talk at first. I hate chats. (lol) Anyway, this movie did the job for me, it scared my kids with those blood-sucking, human killing 'things'. A good movie to kill your spare time."
0,Not good!,Smell does nto stay for a long time...it smells good when you spray but it seems like the scent losses its fragrance right the other moment...Does not stay for a second...Would not recommend it to anyone...Or maybe I got a wrong supplier...I am not sure but there is something funky in the perfume...
0,Jail the author!,"The author of this book should be jailed for murder. According to recent news, this book has been responsible for the murders of at least three children. Amazon should remove this book."
1,MUST READ FOR SINGLES,"It seems like after I hit 30, I found myself mysteriously single. When I read this book, it was like a big ""AHA!"" All of a sudden I KNEW why I was still single. Since reading ""Dating 101"" my life has literally changed. Instead of going home to watch ""Sex and the City,"" I'm actually out having dates. And I'm having a blast! I have so many different guys chasing me that I feel like my fairy godmother came down, waved her magic wand and changed me into a Homecoming Queen. I never knew my life could be so exciting.Whoever said you can't get married after 30 is dead wrong. I was considering spending $2,000 with a dating service, but I just saved almost two grand by buying and reading this book. I can't thank the authors enough."
0,One piece extension?,"I should have read the measurements better, so this is my fault, but one piece extension kit? It doesn't really make the play yard any larger...it's ONE PIECE."
0,Really zero stars!,"I'm a former fan of George's but this is the worst book I've tried to read in years, in fact, I simply couldn't finish it. First time I've wanted to ask Amazon[.com] to refund my money! Should never have been published. Characters are one dimensional, plots are silly, no redeeming literary or entertainment qualities, a general waste of time, either author or publisher cashing in on what was a strong name in her genre."
1,Batman: Vengeance....,"I'll admit, I've been a huge Batman fan since I was a young one. This game, unfortunately, is the second Batman game I've played ever(the first being Batman Returns on the SNES, which is a good game, btw.). I'd been kinda hesitant in trying the game out because I hadn't seen too much on the game anywhere. So, recently, when I couldn't find anything else to play, I picked up the game and I'm glad I did. They got the feel and look of the Cartoon dead-on. If I had any gripe, it'd be with the controls. For the most part, they were good but, in some areas, it wouldn't do like it should. They'd either be too sensitive or not sensitive enough. Regardless, it wasn't enough to take away from the gameplay experience. I finished the game and had me a blast doing it. I hope they come out with a sequel to this game.If you're a Batman fan or if you're a fan of the cartoon series, you'll find quite abit to like about this game. I highly recommend it."
0,A ROYAL PAIN!!!!!!,"The only positive thing I can say about this potty is that I never had a problem with it leaking. Of course...my daughter only ever used it two times. Reason number one is that it was VERY uncomfortable for her. Because there is no padding on the seat, after sitting for just a few minutes (which as you know is a part of potty training), her bottom would have a red mark from the seat cutout and she wanted to get off. At first I thought she just wasn't ready for potty training. Then...I bought another potty with a padded seat (because I was SO annoyed by the super sensetive ""music"" that played every time except when it was supposed to!) and she sat fine and is potty training great now. This potty was not worth the money. A rare fisher price mistake."
0,"Well, expensive.....","This is a good album, but it isn't worth all the extra money. The main difference is the live version ""Down"", which isn't worth all that money. Just buy the regular version."
1,A quick read,"I found Dr. Bass's book to be a quick read, skimming along the surface of decomposition and decay, but providing a glimpse into the learning underway at the Body Farm. I have read extensively in the subject, and finding the same names crop up from time to time is like encountering old friends. It was interesting to read the history of the ""farm"", and of the adjunct sciences that are coming into study."
1,Great Christmas Present,"I just got this camera for Christmas and I love it. I had a previous Cybershot 1.3 megapixels camera for about 4 years It took great pictures, but the battery life was starting to get annoying and I wanted more megapixels. This is a great replacement!! Very easy to use, although I still haven't discovered all of the neat features!"
0,Stine,"I have been using Exuviance products for a couple of years now and have been very satisfied and feel I have found my skin care products that I intend to use for the future. But, unfortunately I had a bad experience when I ordered the products from Amazon.com(through a dealer called Impossible Discounts)- Rejuvenating Treatment Masque, Hydrating Eye Complex and Clarifying Facial Cleanser. All three products were dirty and did not come with any outer box or sealing. Actually, the products looked used! I have sent this complaint to Exuviance, but have not got any reply and now it is two months since I sent the complaint.. I am afraid that I will not buy Exuviance again nor buying at Amazone again after this incident."
0,Not for everyone,"This book is aimed towards college age types with a low budget. This may be the goal of Lonely Planet publishers. It lacks completely in coverage of activities in the area I planned to visit. I am going to the Manuel Antonio area which Mr. Rachowiecki says is an expensive popular area with more than 20 hotels, beautiful beaches, and a National Park. He has two pages on the area and most of that is information on the hotels. His section on the wildlife is textbook stuff without any interesting ideas on how or where to see them. I am very disappointed in the guide."
0,A scary review of ultra-conservative ideals (poorly edited),"After reading the various review, I decided to purchase this book. I quickly learned that this was a ongoing description of ultra-conservative ideals. From suggesting that the oklahoma city bombing was a government plot to idolizing two gun-toting criminals who have shoot-outs with police, this story is a scary view into how some people view the world around them. The main characters are very wooden and consistently praying (while ambushing travelers along the road)The only reason I finished this story was to see if it ever gained a resemblance of sanity (no).In addition, the book was very poorly edited. It was obviously rewritten from an earlier version, but only some of the dates were changed. The timeline made NO SENSE. Please, don't waste you time or money on this nonsense."
0,What exactly was the point?,"I love Nancy Pearl and have read many good books on her recommendations but this one is a head scratcher. Emily is divorced, pining for the husband who left her for another woman, and trying to make a life for herself as an English teacher in a small town.But for someone this provincial, she thinks and talks like a much more experienced woman, something hard to find in 1969. I kept waiting for the point of it all, but it was just one long boring depiction of her sad life and her inability to move on.But you, dear reader, SHOULD move on."
1,Oh grow up,"I will not simply stand by and see my favorite author disparaged. I enjoy every AB installment and await them with baited breath. I ""read"" them in audio form mostly and treasure each. You simply have to allow LKH to develop these characters as she sees fit. If its too hot or too nontraditional stop reading her. If you can stand being challenged or stand for your IMAGINATION to be stretched, then stay tuned. We're working up to a knockdown dragout with the Mother of All Darkness and Jean Claude's sire. How can you stand to miss that?DM was thoroughly entertaining, intriguing, and noncompromising. I hope LKH never changes her original vision to accomodate any lightweights who maybe should stick to lighter faire.It's so hard to find an author like her. I wish she was as prolofic as Nora and could write a different book every 3 months."
0,Not durable...scam artists at customer support,"We bought our photosmart printer about eight months ago and it recently started having paper jam problems. We have probably printed about 40 pictures on it total. The problem go so bad it would not print anymore. We called technical support and they said that it was a ""software"" problem and that the printer's warranty for software issues is only 90 days. They wanted $59 to fix the problem.While the printer does make great pictures I don't see how paper jamming in the printer would be a software issue."
0,More fun than pulling teeth... almost,"While the book presents a couple of interesting ideas, it is, overall slow and very drawn-out. The plot goes nowhere, with the characters (most of which you won't be able to stand) literally going around in circles time after time after boring time. Perhaps the most dissappointig part, though, is that after you've read through all the drudgery, you expect the ending to resolve some of the things that happened and questions that came up along the way. Does it? No..... It just kind of .... stops. If you're looking for a boring, go-nowhere attempt at sci-fi, then this is the book for you."
0,Disappointed!,I bought this for my pup because he likes to watch other dogs on tv. Unfortunately... there is just a narrator the whole time and the puppies don't make any noise! No barking or playing noises at all so he quickly lost interest. I wish it had said it was narrated the whole way through!
0,Women's Aerosoles Jay Bird,I have several aerosoles shoes and sandals and I am very pleased with them. But this one after half day wear got me blisters right away. This style seems to be longer and narrower than my other aerosoles. Because I haven't had any problem before I thought this ones may be just fine. Big mistake. Try them on before buying!
0,A terrible self-serving read,"The trouble with Amway distributors are Amway distributors. They have a tremendous challenge seperating real life from living vicariously through their ""heroes"". Jay Van Andel's oft-told, sclerotic legend of the Amway corporation may engender kudos and accolades from the distributor force at large, but the truth of the matter is that it plays to a very limited, and brain-captured, audience."
0,Doesn't feel comfortable,"I tried the wedge under my belly (24 weeks pregnant) and didn't like how it felt. The foam is too firm and doesn't mold well under my body. The fabric was soft enough, but I wish the velcro opening in the back edge was a covered zipper instead. Now, I use a regular body pillow with a cover that I got cheap ($20) at Target, and I love it! Helps me sleep so much better, and the pillow is soft enough to squish under my belly and between my legs. I didn't want to get one of those expensive pregnancy body pillows. For me, this solution has worked perfectly for side sleeping during pregnancy."
1,finally it's available on cd,"I got the vinyl version in from the '80 's and I love the music. I did all I can to get the vinyl copied to cd, but it was almost impossible without spending a lot of money. Now this concert is available on CD and I am verry happy. I played Children of Sanchez myself in a Big Band and it is one of the greatest tunes I have ever heard, but everyone should listen a couple of times to the solos in Main Squeeze, Feels So Good or Love The Feelin'. Enjoy it....."
1,Ladies With An Attitude!,"As the Hollywood saying goes, scrape off the glitter and what do you find? More glitter.The women of James Parish's ""Hollywood Divas"" are beautiful, talented, controversial, charismatic, passionate and powerful. They are the ones that men want, and the ones women want to emulate.""Divas"" is a great gift for film buffs and celebrity worshipers alike, full of interesting and unexpected factoids about these Tinseltown toughies. Recommended for all those who can't help but be fascinated by them!"
0,Virus Warning,"I bought this at BJ's on 4/15/2010, and when I installed it, I got numerous virus alerts and I hard a difficult time removing it. When I emailed Cosmi to report the problem and at least get a refund, I never got a response."

1,Last song during final credits,"Please help me on this. The last song playing during the final credits was, IMO, by far the most intriguing. Was it Souls Ascending? It was haunting, hard driven and intricate. Great song."
0,very poorly written,This is one of the worst movies that I have ever seen! I was totally confused as to what was going on and could not connect with that lifestyle or what the characters in the movie were trying to accomplish or what the point of the whole movie was. I can't believe this movie won awards!
1,Nice Collection but Tuesday is Gone,"PRONice collection and at a good price.CONYet, I rank the classic ""Tuesday's Gone"" (not included) above these four songs below that were included:Swamp MusicCall Me the BreezeComin' HomeAll I Can Do Is Write About ItThese four are great songs but ""Tuesday's Gone"" is better and more important and relevant in my feeble opinion.NICEThe inclusion of ""The Ballad of Curtis Lowe"" is a nice touch. Haven't seen that one on a greatest hits."
1,excellent,"These are short wraps, but for people looking for short (108) wraps, these are great. Soft and smooth on the skin, quality build, all around solid wraps. Highly recommend 'em.For people who like to mummify their hands, I'd definately recommend longer wraps. But if you are looking to brace the wrists and knuckles inside a pair of gloves, these are perfect. Small, light, not too bulky when wrapped due to shorter length. You might need to relearn how to wrap, but when you do learn how to wrap 108s, these'll be the ones for you."
1,"good times, goood times","NewsRadio was simply the best work-comedy of its time, like ""Mary Tyler Moore,"" ""MASH,"" and ""Cheers"" before it. Because it wasn't afraid to defy the conventions of the form, it didn't get the popularity or respect it deserved. If you're not planning on buying this DVD, you should rent it and see for yourself.If you don't find something to laugh at in every episode, you don't have much of a sense of humor and I bid you good day. I said GOOD DAY, sir!"
0,One of the worst MST3K episodes...,"Forgive me for saying so, all you MSTies out there like myself, but isn't this movie just a little TOO bad? I mean, even if Joel and the Bots were in their best-ever form (which they absolutely aren't in this episode), would it really be worth it to sit through this cinematic atrocity? Well, maybe if they were as funny as in Pod People, one of their best, but still when a movie is just too bad, it seems like the writers have too much to work with and just work on the obvious (e.g. bad music, long senseless scenes, corny dialouge, no plot whatsoever). But as in Pod People, where its bad, but its production values are just good enough to have the MST3K writers sweat a bit, the episode seems to be much better than usual.I would provide some of the best lines from this episode, but there really aren't any. By the by, stay away from CATALINA CAPER also, for similar reasons."
1,gone but not forgotten,"The definitive appraisal of Horne Burns must be that written by the magnificent and irreplaceable Brigid Brophy, herself taken from this life (in her case by MS) long before her time - the Recording Angel sometimes makes some strange decisions about mortality. Brophy's essay on Horne Burns is available in the volume ""Reads"", most recently re-published as a (UK) parperback in 1989. Brophy's volume also will remind you of the greatness of Jean Genet and Ronald Firbank, in whose company Horne Burns emphatically belongs. ""The Gallery"" is brilliant. As Brophy puts it, "" The ultimate irony at the end of all the perspectives of Horne Burns's imaginative world is a kind of bisexuality not between homo- and hetero-sexuality but between sexuality at large and death"". It cannot be emphasized too strongly - Horne Burns is essential reading..."
1,A Fine Solo Album From David Gilmour,"This is not a Pink Floyd album. It's important to get that out of the way because many people will want this to be a Pink Floyd album and will be disappointed because it's not. However this is an excellent David Gilmour album and he has a number of guest musicians on hand to deliver the goods, including Rick Wright. The album is well crafted and there is plenty here for the rock fan (including Floyd fans!) including some wonderful guitar solos. There is a lot of fun music here ('This Heaven' is so funky!). 'Then I Close My Eyes' is one of those laid back slow relaxing tracks - delicious! 'Smile' is a nice blend of acoustic and slide guitar. 'Where We Start' is a really lovely song. Even if you're a doubtful buyer, this album is well worth taking a chance on - you are unlikely to be disappointed, unless you are expecting to hear Pink Floyd..."

1,dog loves it,Nice and sturdy. Well made....the first was damaged during shipment but had no problem on the return and received replacement quickly.
0,Tomb Raider: A Waste of time and Money$$$,"This film was the most dissapointing film of the summer. It wasn't the worst, but it was just a waste of everyone's valuable time. Where to start. Lara croft,is played by Angelina Jolie. She's beautiful but this role hasn't spread her range as an actress. The video game based sequel has Croft in search of an ancient artifact called Pandora's Box, ""The most powerful thing ever imagined."" I'm getting tired of the same old plot of an ancient artifact being searched for. Why can the plot be about how the audience can give a damn about this film. The visuals are nice, but there so boring and repitive that i almost fell asleep. The ending is boring as well. At least this film is better than the original. But not by much. I'll just rather play the new ""Tomb Raider"" game that came out this year. Oh yeah that sucks too."
0,Dust Collector,"I bought this for my 11 month old -- and neither of us is thrilled. The cow, chick and horse come off, but nothing else does...this is frustrating for a curious toddlers. It may be entertaining for smaller babies, but with so much plastic already living in parents' living rooms, I wouldn't waste your money on this one. There is a reason it is selling for 60% off - it's not very much fun!"
1,Best Kipper Snacks I've ever had,"I'm more of sardine fan but I bought these just to try them, as in the past I'd tried several brands of kipper snacks.To be brief, these were great. Neatly packed, fresh, flavorful kippers! So, if you love kippers I can't see how you wouldn't love these, and if you've never tried kippers and you want to, I'd say start here. Though if possible you may want to buy a can retail just to see if kippers are for you. Kippers are a world all their own and just because you like other kinds of fish doesn't necessarily mean you'll like kippers."
0,Invest in a better Trimmer.,Trimmer pulls and pinches even when cutting light swatche of beard.The anticipation of the next painful pull does not make for a enjoyable trimming experience.Would recommend strongly to invest in a better/heavier duty trimmer.I guess you get what you pay for.
0,Great Disapointment,"This book isn't worth the time spent on reading it.Great in generalities, but very little in specifics.Doesn't even provide menus to follow. If you buy it be prepare to go to a nustritionist to implement it."
0,Sisterland,"I thought I would like this book. I was obviously wrong, because I was so bored I couldn't even read any more after I got past like, page 50. And that's saying something, because every time I pick up a book I just HAVE to finish it. But this was the one time I honestly couldn't read it.The reason I gave it two stars was because it might be a good book, but I just couldn't take the time to finish it."
1,awesome movies,The best movies i have ever seenenjoyable and excellent for people that are crazy for cars...Try the french version because they have great accents and the french actually sound quite funny aswell
0,SO AVERAGE...,"Diana DeGarmo has an okay pop voice. It just happens leave me me unbelievably bored and unsatisfied. She sings with no soul or conviction, and her high notes are just ""okay..."" She needs a lot of work on her lower range because she has a very dry one. In a competitive world of Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, Stacie Orrico, Hilary Duff, Ashlee Simpson, Avril Lavinge etc etc, I don't see where Diana DeGarmo can fit into this. Each of the artists that I mentioned brings something different to the table, wheras Diana is just like every one of them rolled into one. It's not a good thing."
1,"efficient, powerful","I didn't pay much for this hair dryer, but I sure do like it. I've had it about 1 month now, use it several times a week. It's powerful and runs well. I'd recommend it for sure! Especially for the price! Why pay 50+ on something just as good?"
0,Outdated!!,"Do not buy this book. It's an outdated rant mostly directed against John Thompson (who hasn't been the Georgetown basketball coach in 5 years) and Leo O'Donovan (who retired as University president 3 years ago). This book does not even redeem its age by being funny. The jokes are unoriginal and dry. This book is one in a series of ""I Hate _______________"" books. I swear they just change the names of people and places and use the same rants for every school. Not worth your time and money for this disappointment."
1,Very Good Movie,We purchased this movie a watched it about a month ago. It is a really good movie. I give it an A+.
1,"What did he expect, the Duke?","I feel a little embarrassed for Mr. LaChance regarding his previous review... did he really get the impression from anything on this video box that it was actually going to be Ellington himself performing? The labeling/packaging is absolutely clear: these are tribute performances by Dianne Reeves, Randy Brecker, Tom Scott, Robben Ford, Bill Evans, Roger Kellaway, Ndugu Chancler... some of the very best in the business. And ""jungle,"" Mr. LaChance??"

1,Love this dryer!,"Very high Quality. I have 3 dogs. mixed breed, lab and an australian shepherd. I show the australian shepherd and I was told that I needed a dog dryer to fluff my little girl up. I decided this would be a good blower beacuse they are all over the show grounds and they had very good amazon review! My trainer has one, my freinds have them ..... One of my friends who have been showing golden retrievrs for 20+ years uses this blower. One of her blowers is 20+ years old and works like new! VERY High quailty! Also Amazon is cheaper to buy from than your show vendor.(I got mine at Petco for a cheap price,new) Please people, you can't find a ""silent or quiet"" blower or machine so don't complain if this machine makes some noise! Because it sure does. If your dog doesn't like the noise of the vacume them she/he will probally not like the noise of this. You are not if your dog doen't like this sound, my lab doesn't like it ether. Very Very High quality. love this dryer!"

1,Great and Durable,"This lego was great and was the second episode 3 lego I got. I think that lego could have made this item a little bit better but overall, it was pretty cool. If lego had only put a little more on it, it would be the perfect lego. Still, it is a great lego and is defenitally worth the money."
0,Correct spelling is a PRINCIPAL requirement for a writing guide...,"In theory, I would completely approve of the idea of enlivening this useful classic writing guide with illustrations. However, having examined this particular edition, I can't get past the horrifying error at the top of page 147, in which the spelling ""principle"" is substituted for the correct form of the adjective ""principal,"" as in ""main,"" or ""chief."" This passage is supposedly from the introduction to the book's first edition by William Strunk, Jr., who would have made no such mistake. (It is however a common one, to judge by its appearance in at least one of the Amazon reader reviews of this book).Didn't anyone at The Penguin Press proofread this book? To introduce this type of basic error into a revered reference book is an unforgiveable disservice to the masters of writing. Strunk and White must be rolling over in their graves..."
0,Not Progress,"The last track, ""Break"", had potential, butI don't recommend buying this expensive CD for that one tune.I wouldn't call this album ""progressive rock"", because by 1971, rock had already progressed much further than this.Here's my recipe for progressive rock :Step one - write legitimate songs on the level of The Beatles, either vocal tunes or instrumentals.Step two - construct elaborate arrangements for those tunes utilizing highly advanced classical and jazz technology.If you can't do step one, don't bother with step two."
0,Where is Paul & what have you done with him??,"OUCH. Was he trying to sell out, go for a pop chart hit?Boring. Really bad singing & sampling. Annoyingly simple techno that starts with nothing and goes nowhere. I am heavily dissapointed. Disc 2 is slightly better, but I found I could not make it through most tracks. Paul Oakenfold has some great CDs, but this is not one of them."

0,Not as funny as the previews,"I am a big fan of Seth McFarland and Family Guy, so I was expecting non-stop hilarity. Unfortunately, this movie was like a 2 1/2 hour episode of Two and a half men--all bong scenes and fart jokes.A waste of my $5."
1,One of the best voices ever...,"If you're a fan of JT Taylor and the classics he did with Kool & The Gang, you owe it to yourself to experience this single! JT's voice is smoother and more dynamic than ever on the track - he really has mastered his own style and range as a singer. Rich deep & smooth, this track is classic JT."
0,Monster Squad...Should Get the Firing Squad!,"A film notable only because the screenwriter was Shane Black (of LETHAL WEAPON fame). Otherwise, this is an unwatchable kiddie adventure movie with a stable of tired old movie monsters (i.e. Frankenstein's monster, Dracula, the Wolfman, the Creatre from the Black Lagoon, and the Mummy). The script is bad, the kids are not very likable,and the plot is very thin. It's hard to believe that this film was produced on the grounds that Shane Black's name was on the cover of the screenplay. What a waste of celuloid. ..."
0,6 months of Use - Disappointment,"My old Dewalt died and I needed a new drill.I have several pieces of Hitachi equipment so I figured I would stick with the brand.This drill is complete waste. The biggest problem I have is with the chuck. It is constantly slipping and losing grip on the bit.No matter how much I tighten it, it always comes loose. You can have the best drill in the world, but if it doesnt hold bits properly - its useless.Skip this drill and get something else."
0,A great disappointment,"If you loved 'Snow Falling on Cedar's' (as I did), and buy this book as the next great novel by Guterson -- you are likely to be disappointed. For me, the great plot and vivid writing were missing. This was a bland and slow-moving story. If you must read it -- wait for the paperback. It is not worth the price of the hardcover."
1,Works perfect,Does exactly as stated and holds bits. Do not have to worry about bits slipping any more.
0,Didn't work..,"The 1st time I tried this, it felt like it did work a little. The effect was very subtle if anything. I actually think it might have been the high alcohol content...As I also tried the pastilles which have no alcohol & they have no effect at all. Thumbs down. I try to be fair but I must be honest when I say that after the 1st dose I did not notice any effect at all."
1,The best of them all!,Lover Awakened to me is the best of the whole series... you understand why Zsadist is the darkest of the brothers and is so touched when finally there is a female who accepts him for who he is and is able to touch his heart!
0,A Very Disappointing End To A Great Series,"I've looked through every paragraph reference to find the 'real' ending, only to realise that the last depressing paragraph was in fact the real end. The book begins with some real promise by having the factor of Foxglove present, and it's good to revisit some characters from previous books. With such a promising start it's a pity the book didn't have another 400 or so paragraphs to take it forward. The ending strays away completely from the original quest and sounds like one of the bad endings where you die. Only a slight hint suggests that this would've been continued in a seventh book, but sadly I hear there isn't one. Perhaps the authors were given their marching orders and the book had to be finished unsatisfactorily? There's simply no other good reason why a great series like this should've ended like this. Very disappointing."

0,poor workmanship,"The product arrived --LATE ---Then, the first time I went to assemble it the wheel holder broke. Outside of the wheel holder breaking, I wasn't real impressed with the stability of the system itself. I have since bought something, around the same price point, that is more stable and better constructed."
0,Last House on the Left,The movie was recommended to us and was a huge disappointment. It was definitely a B rated movie. The music DID not fit with the plot or the scenes. We ended up selling it to the person who recommended it.
1,"Best wrestling game ever, until the next installment of this","This game has all the features that a wrestling game should have! Trust me, I own all the systems, wwf raw is garbage for the xbox, moves [are bad] and the people move like robots, for the gamecube, gameplay is horrid and the moves are very limited. This smackdown will satisfy you with all your needs, except for the new characters in wrestling up to date since this game was released before the wcw/ecw storyline. the only thing this game is missing, is muscle detail, blood, and breaking items (breaking box on opponent doesnt happen) other than that this game has the movements, the crowd, commentating(even though its pretty whack but keeps the excitement unlike the gamecube and xbox) and its actually fun, trust me if you own all the systems, this is the wrestling game to get, dont fall for the new characters in the other games its not worth it!"

0,One of the most boring horror movies I have ever seen,For me I found the movie didn't get decent until the last 20 minutes or so. Seriously we get one kill and then for next hour all we have is a our main lead girl babysitting the house and just wandering around and listening to music. Then the last 20 minutes we finally get some action and even that is a let down.
0,terrible,I purchased this blanket because I loved the color. That is the only thing it has going for it. There were feathers all over the place and I keep finding random ones in rooms on different floors! It is now stored in an airtight bag because I can't toss it- I paid good money for it.

0,Here's the Scoop. NOT!,"Like the other reviewers noted the plastic parts that drive the scraper malfunction quickly. I got 3 or 4 uses out of the scoop before the cheap plastic broke. Thing is, the scoop itself feels hefty and sturdy and would be an excellent utensil if they replaced the plastic parts with metal. The scoop stills looks and works fine other than losing the scraper to help free the ice cream from it."

0,ripoff,"The ""rare musical performances"" amounted to a few seconds Joy Division performing. The whole dvd kept giving the viewer teaser shots if you will of live performances but never delivered. It never played a song in it's entirety. The ""rare interviews"" as described were garbled and very hard to understand. Very disappointing."
1,"A little too physical, but it doesn't suck","Well I'm gonna fess up that my favorite song is ""Too Physical."" It's fun to moan to. The intro to ""suck"" is fun. This cd'll startle you if you don't pay attention. You'll try to turn it up to hear the quiet intros only to have your ears ripped off. But the best NIN is the fragile. Go buy it."
0,A waste of money!,You guessed it. About the 3 1/2 month mark the hard drive goes out. A piece of crap. I refuse to pay $175.00 for refurbished job. The customer service support is awful. I know the price is inviting especially for 20 GB Mp3 player. Look at all the past reviews and you will see a common thread. If I pay $220.00 for a MP3 player I can reasonably assume it should last for a decent amount of time. I am currently deployed in Afghanistan and as of today without my music. Buy elsewhere there are plenty of choices. Say no to poor quality and to a company who outsources their jobs.

1,Still works great after 2 years,"This is by far my favorite appliance. I have a cusinart toaster that it pur garbage but they make a really nice walfle iron. It has an indicator light that goes green when the waffle iron is ready for batter and then when it is cooked, it makes a soft crackling sound and you take them out and the waffles are perfect every time.I usually spray the waffle iron the first time of each use; once per day or less if not using it daily."

I replaced her gift."
1,Gilligan's Island Season 1,"I have been watching Gilligan's Island for many years, and although I have seen all the episodes, I am never tired of watching an episode one more time. Every time I watch Gilligan's Isle I laugh a lot, because each and every episode is so funny. I love comedies, and this certainly is one. I really recomend it to anyone who is a lover of comedy. Although the episodes were made a while ago, I love to watch them. They can be family movies, or movies you watch while doing something else - you can watch them in any situation. I can't wait until I buy the next 2 seasons of Gilligan's Island, and I recomend them as well."
0,Weak on Theory,If you're interested in an overview of the subject of fuzzy logic this book may be adequate for your need. It is primarily a manual on how to use the shareware version of the software which is provided. I found this book inadequate in explaining the theory behind fuzzy logic
0,awful,"Why. WHY?! This movie joins Alien Resurrection and Jurassic Park 3 as movies that took a good idea, ran way too long, and ended up stupid. this had so much potential and it just died. We sat in the theater laughing because this is histerical, but it wasn't supposed to be. The ""funny"" parts were boring and the serious part cracked me up. Gotta say though, that the part where she locks him in a dog cage is kinda funny, again not meant to be, but it is. Oh, and why would they pick Claire Danes for this? She did nothing but scream throughout the whole thing, the relevation regarding her in the future was seen a mile away, and where was Linda Hamilton? I'll tell you; she probably took one look at the script and wisely said hells no. So easy solution, we kill her off.So sad. go watch the frist two, forget yuo ever saw this one, and enjoy your Terminator world where there is a possibility of a happy future.Terminatrix was hot though..."
1,Great Music,"I have been looking for the original soundtrack to Blade Runner for years,I even recorded the love theme from the movie I had on tape. I was sure thrilled to see it was available on CD years later. The ""Love Theme"" is my favorite. ""Rachel's Song"" and ""Blade Runner"" are my next two favorites. The tape recorded version was very hissy and full of noises, but the CD is so crystal clear, and an extended version of total perfection. Vangelis is great, and this CD is a masterpiece."
1,Hugs and kisses for your fondue.,"Even though it looks more at home at Christmas time (or maybe Halloween?) or a chocoholic's pad, it turns out to do a very nice job on a cheese fondue or, as my cousin likes to do, keep butter melted to dip her crab or lobster. Easily cleaned and eminently portable (serves only 1 or 2 people), a handy item for its uses and an interesting decoration."
0,"Uncomfortable fit, noise canceling so-so","My biggest complaint is that my ears hurt after wearing them for more than 15 minutes. I'm not sure why they designed the ear cups to be a long oval shape. The noise-canceling is so-so; I fly a lot and the noise canceling is somewhat of a reprieve from the sounds of flying, but it's nothing special."
1,"good product, but check it out","I've purchased 3 of these through Amazon, and my experience with the first 2 was 5 stars. It works good for high pressure tires and the built in gauge is nice. It's a bit tight of a fit on the valve stem but a little wiggling gets it off.That last one I got appears like it was partially disassembled for some reason. I tightened the loose pieces and it started to work so I guess everything is OK. I would have exchanged it but I didn't notice this until I actually needed to use it and by that time my return window had expired. I normally check things out when I get them, but this just wasn't obvious."
0,This machine leaks horribly!,"I recently bought this machine, which works fine except that it leaks horribly all around the filter holder. Water goes everywhere, into the coffee, all over the machine. I tried compacting the coffee more and less, using different grinds of coffee, nothing worked. It was just a bad machine. I assumed that it was defective, so I sent it back, and got another one, which did exactly the same thing. On the positive side, it did heat up very fast, and would have made espresso very fast, and if it werent for the extreme leaking, I would have kept this machine. The leaking was so bad it made the machine unusable. Do not buy this machine!"

0,Blown Bulb = Blown Money,"I normally take 1 star review with a grain of salt. The front light is extra large, but I can deal with that. I bought 2 of these sets. The back lights are working ok, for now, but my wife and I used them for 2.5 rides. Her light blew on the second ride and mine on the next. I checked the batteries, solder points, etc. I jiggled the light and you could hear the blown bulb. Not worth replacing, maybe worth trying to return (although I glued a team mascot to the top of mine [the only thing the enormous size is good for]) definitely not worth purchasing... Trusted name in bikes just got a little shadier."
1,West African Adinkra Symbols Rubber Stamp Set,"I am glad I disregarded the negative comments about this set of Adinkra stamps. I needed smaller stamps for my audience to use during a hands-on activity following my presentation on the symbols. I wanted them to emulate the process for stamping fabric, including creating a grid and filling it in with symbols in a repetitive manner. Larger, more authentic stamps would not have allowed this, given the size of the fabric swatches being used and the budget for the program. I found the booklet useful, but I had done a great deal of research on the symbols, and had sufficient information to counter any shortcomings. If you need stamps to use with a group, I recommend this set. Augment it by having some larger calabash Adinkra stamps on display as part of your program."
0,The Bureaucrat of Monticello,"In this book Noble Cunningham has managed to make one of the most fascinating figures in American history pedestrian. He provides a dutiful recounting of the facts of Jefferson's life, but never makes him come alive. His thesis--that Jefferson saw the use of reason as the highest human undertaking--is certainly valid, but Jefferson was a man of enormous contradictions, none of which are truly explored here. This book makes the man who said ""Democracy ought to be periodically washed in blood"" seem like a hardworking civil servant."
1,Silken-sound Band Backs New York Style R&B Star,"Prime Time Funk lends a balletic background to funk/ska/R&B and Latino tracks with a variety of graceful and perfect sounds for cocktail parties, kicking back at home, and room for dancing--day or night. ""Champs Elysees"" is the most cosmopolitan track, providing the mood of moonlight on still water. Ronnie Leigh's vocals make the listener immediately caught up in his dynamic and versatile vocal richness."
0,Terrible vacuum,"If I could give this vacuum a 0 rating, I would. After only 4-5 uses (Yes, I cleaned out the bin) it clogged up. The attachments only worked once and quit.

1,I ordered the wrong one...,"I'm a John Waters fan. I was unaware that the R rated version is called the ""neuter"" version because it has been censored. (Cut scenes and some foul words replaced with more ""acceptable"" ones.) Now I have to purchase the NC-17 Version to get the true John Waters experience. LOOK CLOSELY AT THE PICTURE, THE R RATED VERSION SAYS ""NEUTER VERSION"" ON IT!To add insult to injury, IT WAS MORE EXPENSIVE!"

1,Best Sitcom On Televsion Now,"The creators/writers of this show also did Frasier, and it shows in their sharp-witted, sophisticated scripts. This show is a future classic; the cast has great chemistry, and the writing is top-notch. CBS inexplicably seems determined to kill it, but here's hoping it gets the chance it deserves, back on its original night. Regardless, I'll be first in line to buy any DVD of the series."
0,wasteful,We received a Tassimo Machine for a gift. We loved the performance and ease of use! BUT hated the excessive packaging of T- Discs and the fact that every time we wanted a drink it meant using the plastic foil covered T-Disc and then off to the landfill. We cannot justify the waste every time we want a warm drink.Great machine! But wish they had re-usable discs!J & J
1,Very Useful Little Towels,"These towels are great for many things: washing windows, washing your car, dusting, etc. These towels hold up well and collect a lot of the dirt that is on many different surfaces.The towels will turn a noticeable black after cleaning with them for a while; however, just throw them in the washing machine and they turn back to that nice yellow that they were when you first got them. You can dry them in the dryer just make sure it is a low heat and do not use any fabric softener.I would recommend them for everyone who is doing any form of cleaning since they hold up well and work well. My only complaint is that I wish they were thicker, but this is not a big complaint since they supply you with 12 at about $13 (~$1 each plus tax). Purchase these, you will not regret it!"

I'm planning next week to get the Fiskars Hatchet, the Fiskars Splitting Axe, and I'm also planning to get a Granfors Bruks Sharpener to replace this one.P.S. The reason I gave this sharpener 2 stars instead of 1 is because at least it made the axe sharp again."
0,Deserter's Song's this isn't.,"what a pretencious piece of drivel. jonathan has finally lost his mind. Just look at the picture of him on the inside cover. i think that in trying to be too artistic, he's lost site of what's really important...the music. The highlights are ""a drop in time"" and ""the dark is rising"", the others are flat and droning. Lyrically, not nearly as good his previous efforts like ""Opus 40"" and ""endlessly"". Otherwise, I'm a huge fan of their stuff. Go get Deserter's Songs,Boces and Yerself is Steam but not See You on the Other Side, that stinks too."
0,Truman Capote Fan,"I just received and watched this 'documentary'. I'm struggling to find something positive about it, but the fact is, it is the lowest quality biographical documentary I've ever seen. In fact, I'm amazed at the lack of substance this video has. It is about 10% actual footage/photos of the subject, and 90% non-relevant (filler) scenery. It suffers factually due to an obvious lack of research, especially surprising because of the great amount of material/photos that exists on Capote. This video is a disgrace to one of America's great writers. Buy the A & E Biography of Capote, it is first rate (but Too short!)"

1,A Radical Perspective on Ayurveda,"This book not only gives one of the best summaries of modern day Ayurveda I have ever read, but also shows how modern Ayurveda must be complimented by a more ancient Ayurvedic model to be truly effective.

1,Another great outing from the '57 Blue Note sessions,"For those who where lucky to get a copy of the Mosaic #154 The Complete February 1957 Jimmy Smith Blue Note Sessions (3CDs or 5 Q-LP) box, this CD is an overlap. But who cares, the sleeve must be in every serious JOS collection. The solo organ works on ""All the things you are"" and ""Zing"" are surprisingly modern and display the JOS mastery on controlling both manuals and pedals and modern approach to the tunes. Art Blakey sitting in with an organ trio on a few tracks is probably the only recording ever made with Art with organ (no organists in his official discography). Eddie McFadden on guitar delivers like many of his supporting role with organists. This session is classic for the '56 - '59 period at Blue Note but it's not the highlight from the same period even when you get approx. 20min with bonus tracks from the original LP."
1,Beginner to Pro,"The 4th Edition of the Camera Assistant's Manual by focal press author David Elkins is a must have for the beginner as well as the seasoned pro.

0,Needless Beep,"The fan's industrial design is compact and sleek. The build quality is sub-par - rubber pads that keep the unit from scuffing the floor have all fallen off, the fan makes an annoying ticking sound for about 10 minutes and then mysteriously goes away. But the single worst thing about this fan is that the engineers designed it to beep whenever a button is pressed. The fan beeps to turn on, beeps to change speeds, beeps to oscillate, and most annoyingly - it beeps when you turn it off! Why? Parents who would consider buying this to use around sleeping children beware. The only time it doesn't beep is during auto-off in sleep mode - mercifully. I do not recommend this fan."

0,BDAM (Big Dumb American Movie),"What is so wrong with an epic (You know, those stories that have been around for thousands of years that look at the human condition?) that Hollywood believes need improvement? This movie is nothing more than a revenge picture and Achilles is nothing more than a murderous thug. By the end of the movie he has allegedly learned of honor, trust, and understanding. In this we are supposed to find him noble. But, as we all know, thugs do not learn these things. This makes the movie hollow. For the improved version of this movie(...)."
1,Like taking a film course!,"Watching the ""Criterion Collection"" version of ""Brazil"" is like taking a fascinating film course.

0,"I don't like the ""Real"" One King Down","I know that ""God Loves Man Kills"" did not have the original singer of One King Down, but I must say it is the only album that sounded professional, original, and bad ass. This album is back to One King Down's roots as they now have their original singer back. And with the original singer comes their armature basement recorded like sound again. If you like the old school hard core sound this album may be for you, however, I am wishing the ""God Loves Man Kills"" singer reunites at some point."

0,Surgically cleansed Monk,"I think the reviewer that said, ""I don't even like jazz and I like this album"" says it all. Here we have yet further evidence of Marsalis trying to cleans jazz of all its communicative African roots in blues.If all you hear in jazz is good tone and swing, then buy up the Marsalis catalogue and call it a day. But if you want to hear ""real"" jazz...then look elsewhere. If you are looking for a Monk tribute disc (because you own everything in the Monk catalogue and STILL can't get enough), I would suggest either Steve Lacy (he has released many recordings covering Monk) or the 3 disc set with Alexander von SchlippenbachMonk's Casino: The Complete Works of Thelonious Monk.This disc is like a ""Kenny G plays Monk"" tribute."
1,huge on the desk top,"I am fairly happy with this machine. It takes up a lot of space on my desk, but as I use it all day long, I don't really want to put it across the room. I mostly use the print feature. It has only jammed a few times in the year or so that I have used it. As for the scans, they usually come out crooked, but I don't often need high quality scans, so I'm ok with that most of the time. I've only used the OCR once or twice and it did ok. It made some mistakes, but the font on the original was rather small. We also have the similar model with the faxBrother MFC-8460n 30ppm Network Multifunction Laser Printerand we are happy with it, too. It makes good copies, but I don't usually try two sided printing or copying on this machine."

1,Beautiful Voices,"Mr Culver's review is certainly opinionated (and unfortunately expressed as fact) with respect to the producton of 'Voices of Life'. If he truly was up on his facts he'd know that Eddie Jobson didn't produce anything by Yes, but rather he is foremost a talented multi-genre violinist and keyboardist (UK, Roxy Music) as well as producer; but not for Yes. Eddie Offord was Yes' producer of choice for a time.Fine production values do not lessen or dilute this performance. In particular, the version of Polegnala E Toudora presented on this work is wonderfully emotional, and I feel the ambient quality of the recording enhances the experience. Some other recordings I've heard of this song sound a bit flat by comparison.Perhaps a 'purist' would differ, but this is a finely compiled work that I keep going back to."
1,Most comfortable,"This is one of the most confortable thrones I've owned, and I doubt if I'll ever switch brands or models.First, this is an infinitely adjustable style throne versus the type where you adjust it using a bolt and spaced holes. This one is adjustable to virtually any fraction of an inch, and more importatly, the seat is big, cushioned and comfortable.Another nice touch is the memory lock that allows you to quickly find your best setting. If you do multiple gigs this single feature will save a lot of time in the long run (not to mention your back and posterior!)DW makes great, well designed hardware - always with working drummers in mind - and this throne is yet another example to their committment to quality and excellence."
0,Not really a good choice,"This book really isn't that much of a help. They just show nude figures! Use Christopher Hart books or something else less pointless. Whatever the book is really about, it focuses more on the ""main"" parts. It's a big piece of junk. That's my main point."

Returning it to bring it to amazon's attention, not for the sake of a refund..."
1,The Best Voice and CD ever,"This CD is pure gold and I recommend this masterpiece and it soothes the ear and soul. It's the best CD ever and he should have won the competetion.

IT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE OF HIS HUMOUROUS OUTLOOK THAT HE WAS ABLE TO ENDURE THE PAIN. I'VE ALSO READ ""TIS"" AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED. WHAT A WONDERFUL WRITER.

1,INCREDIBLE,"Many complain that this album was not what they expected. I for one have grown passed the stage where I expect the same thing from an artist every time. Having said that, know that this album is different from anything before it, just as ""Empires"" was different from ""Praise the Fallen"", and so forth. This album has VNV Nation's most inredible music ever. The lyrics are beautiful, haunting, and spiritual (in a good way). The sound will make you drool. From the harder-hitting tracks of ""Epicentre"" and ""Genesis"" to the incredibly beautiful ""Airships"" (a true masterpiece), this album never disappoints. Buy it now."
1,Peek into the mind of one of America's leading industrial designers,"This book is a peek into the mind of one of America's leading industrial designers of the 20th century. In a surprisingly down-to-earth and highly readable style, Dreyfuss recounts how he got into the field, how he started his company, how the design process works, and the designer's relationship with clients, money, and users. The book is full of examples and anecdotes. Although there are many important lessons to be learned from Dreyfuss' wisdom, the book is superficial, not delving into any details."

1,shipped item doesn't match product picture,"I saw this stand in a video and really thought it looked decent. Most monitor stands out there are inelegant and just plain ugly. This seemed to be the best of the bunch. Unfortunately, what I received doesn't match the photo that Amazon has posted for the product picture. The gray feet are thicker, more rounded in the rear, and the black top is deeper. Also, it doesn't have the three exposed screws on the either side or the concave groove at the front. Instead it is completely flat and has ""ALLSOP"" written in white. I'll keep it because it serves the purpose I require, but I really wish it was the one in the photo."

1,A 6-pack of Kotter articles,"In the reviews below, only Godfrey notices that this book is simply a collection of 6 previously published Harvard Business Review articles (1979-1997). As such, the book is a handy one-stop shop of Kotter's leadership and management writings over the years, and these articles contain nothing new. One might have wished for Kotter's current commentary on each of the individual articles.His original contribution to this volume is the first chapter, where he retroactively imposes order on and draws lessons from the earlier works. Overall, this book is a useful compendium of Kotter's ideas from the past 30 years for those who are unfamiliar with his work."

Rather then donate the book for someone else with different taste in books to find it I decided the best option would be destroy it so no one else would have to suffer.I found the story depressing, without meaning, and void of hope. Rather then continuing on with life you leave everyone behind and go out in the street and play in traffic."
1,A Place Called Freedom,"The first Ken Follott book that I have read and thougherly enjoyed it. So much so, that I immediately ordered another book of this authors which I am now reading and enjoying just as much. I consider ""A Place Called Freedom"" an excellent read. Starting in the coal mines of Scotland and moving on to the early colonization days of America it is a wonderful story that brings home the hardships of living in those earlier times."

It was unforunate because this book had such a cool front cover, but Clark just went on and on and on about his characters and every now and then (very briefly) he would say oh yeah and theres vampires in the sewers. Then it was back to the characters sitting down for a chat AGAIN. I like developed characters but there is a such thing as to much. Its the same thing as going into a horror flick about vampires and thinking man I hope the first hour is a bunch of talking with some action in the last 30 minutes. Which is the formula I'm assuming this book followed because again I couldn't make myself finish it. Wow this book was just boring."

1,The Lion's Paw,"I grew up on a boat and I was always looking for stories about other kids on boats. This was and is one of my all-time favorites. Nick and Penny are orphans and Nick is always running away. This time they run away together and wind up on a sloop called the Hardalee, owned by Ben's father, who is MIA in the Pacific during WWII. Ben's uncle is about to sell the Hardalee. Ben's not going to stand for that, and Penny and Nick get a lot farther away than they thought they would. Oh, and they're not orphans, by the way, they're eganaps. Because, you know, they weren't in an orphanage, they were in an eganahpro.Great characters, you-are-there setting (Florida), a satisfying plot and an ending that will make you cheer. I have been hunting down used copies of this book all my life to give to the kids in my extended family. I'm chivvying my publisher to acquire the rights and bring it back into print. Possibly with an introduction by...yes, that would be me."

0,"If you want to read it, check it out from the library!","Woodiwiss has produced a well-written book with a disturbing plot line. After reading the ""rape"" scene, I found myself thinking there is no difference between Brandon's character and her aunt's brother, except looks and the fact that Brandon was able to rape her first.Throughout the book, Brandon continues to treat Heather badly. Woodiwiss does not build enough justification for how Heather could possibly fall in love with Brandon, since he treats her poorly.If an author wishes to write a rape scene in a novel, she must be careful how she carries it off. When Woodiwiss wishes to do so next, she should look at Judith McNaught's book, Whitney My Love for an example."

As others put it, it's repetative and droning numbness and you would need to be very patient for an hour just to scratch the surface on this one.Not really for me - I prefer bands like ORANGE SUNSHINE, HIGH RISE, SPIRITUAL BEGGARS, THE QUILL, ETERNAL ELYSIUM, ATOMIC BITCHWAX and their ilk."
1,quite an experience.,"i am glad they finally were able to release this album on cd. the vinyl has been a constant visitor to my turntable since it was released last year. at times, the music sounds very familiar. at other times, you forget you are listening to music at all, until the record ends and you are sitting in your underwear, feeling that weird chill coming from the window, you left open when there was still some light left in the sky and the warmth that comes along with it. then i get dressed and have to replay the album to hear what i missed. it is one of those albums that seems to play differently each time it is listened to, but always makes you want to hear more. i truly love this gem. it is quite the experience."
0,Defective Product,"Unbelievable, dismal, strange, poor, system. Returned even though I may not get a refund because I don't have a receipt, just as a matter of principal. Did not block or prevent Spam, Virus', Popups, Ads etc. Installed a competitive product which did all the above immediately without the gyrations you have to go through with McAfee, ie, adding an address book. With the competition it was automatically imported, correctly, without the 4 steps McAfee required. I can't understand how this could be sold, the software on the disc was defective, or an early incorrect CD."
1,r & b based rock performed by vetran musicans,"Veteran musicans,seldom recorded launch cd . 6 original songs by bassest Bob Cosgrove and 5 covers. Rocken stuff great for a drive down the 4 lane. Caution this will make you want to get up and dance."
0,Did I watch a different movie?,"Without going into a lot of detail, this was the most unerotic movie I've watched in a long time; on a par with the worst of the CineMax soft-core movies. The scene with the beast is ridiculous and would appeal only to the sexual level of a teenager and even then only one who had never come across bestiality and found it to be erotic. The phallus in the scene looks like the rubberized end of a baseball bat with hand cream shooting out every 5-10 seconds. While the overall story line and acting is reasonable, and the two r-rated sex scenes are passable the whole point of the movie is this scene which is laughable for its lack believability and true eroticism. My copy went straight in the trash."
1,Hot Killer Babes!,"There seems to be a dojo master called Muneakira who turns females in samurai masters with powerful elemental powers by kissing them. There is a lot of nudity with large breasts, but no observed sex acts. There are several females characters with their own unique personalities."
1,"Structural Equation Modeling With Lisrel, Prelis, and Simpli","Offer different softwares(LISREL8, PRELIS2,SIMPLIS) and cover single, multiple groups analyses and provide MTMM model, I thought Dr. Byrne's book one of the most useful resource to apply structural equation model for social science research."
0,Review of videos,"To state these movies are meat and potatoe type westerns would be stretching the truth. More like cornbread and beans. Sam Elliot must really have been hungry. Definitely had that ""made for tv"" look."

1,review,"I borrowed this book from a friend who got at aused booksale.He was surprised by it and liked it.This would be a great movie ;but,would not be very flatteringto the US military and the politics behind Reaganism of the1980's,1990's,and (retro 1990's) present political hysteria andmilitary drama . Great read for Tom Clancy readers who findDan Quayle to be a brainiac compared to G.Dubbuh Bush--du jour of the oval office. Und you vill like it!Very euro -esiponage of the 1980's...."
1,Going Strong!,"McGarrett's back, and he's in top form. Some superb episodes here, including the first of seven that Jack Lord directed (one each season, Seasons 6-12). Someone else wrote that Jack Lord IS Steve McGarrett. I agree. It is very difficult to detect where the actor leaves off and the character begins, and that is a sign of some VERY good acting. Season 6 is a winner!"
0,Stupid Beyond Reckoning,"If bad writing were a crime, Richard Matheson would be on death row.As it is, I feel like I've done hard time by reading this book.Mr. Matheson uses the protagonist in this book as a vehicle to float every left-leaning, New Age theory imaginable: he's pro-reincarnation, anti-gun, anti-violence, pro-animal rights. And the results are almost laughably absurd. After the main character has been sodomized and beaten and is fleeing a psycopath in the forest, our hero stops his escape to rescue a cougar that has been trapped by a fallen log. Why not brew a little latte' while you're at it? And after the psychopath rapes the protagonist's wife as a prelude to murdering the hero and the hero gains the upper hand, the protagonist refuses to kill the pyschopath ""because that would make him like the psychopath."" Huh?It's this kind of muddleheaded thinking that the reader must endure thoughout the book. Save your money and your time. Look elsewhere."
1,Hard Hitting,"I wish that I couldn't believe what Mr. Savage has to say, but I do. He is well educated, no nonsense and to the point. He does not ""beat around the bush"". I like that! I highly recommend his book."
1,Excellent hoses,"We just ordered two more of these from Amazon (they are significantly cheaper at the moment than the local stores). These are the favorites among our construction company due to the light weight, durability, and the fact that they really don't kink.For those of you who are just working around the house, any old hose will do. But for those of you in the professional arena, the lighter weight will be a blessing in the 8th hour when you're trying to get those walls up before dark so that you can get paid in the next draw. We stick with the 100 lenght because we are building hotels and such, besides going from the 50 to the 100 is only a few dollars difference and is worth it if it keeps you moving.Highly recommended"
1,Excellent product,This is exactly what I was looking for. My son Max absolutely loves it and it truly is fun. It was easy to install and sturdy enough. Great deal for the price.
0,Don't waste your moeny.,Product did not come with lubricant and batteries as advertised when I purchased it. The power is week and therefore don't waste your money on this product.
0,The wires disintegrate!,"I bought the MDR-EX51LP and wrote this review - it applies to the EX71 too.----------------------------------I liked these - they fit me well and sounded good. I can even sleep with them on.Unfortuneately, the insulation on the wire disintegrated within 4 months. It starts with a crack or tear where the wire meets the plug. Soon the insulation stretches, wrinkles, and delaminates until it comes off.I thought it was a freak accident so I bought the next step up as a replacement, the MDR-EX71SL. I'm sorry to report that the same thing happened to it - only within three months. I'm trying to find the warrenty information now so I can send them back.You can't buy these ear buds - you can only rent them until they sadly disintegrate around your neck."
1,Star wars kinghts of the old republic,Love the game one of the best RPG's of all time if you don't mind some old grafics and are interested a great rpg pick this one up totally worth the money and time!
1,Loved the first one so much I'm buying another.,"I got one of these as a Christmas present some 11 years ago, and it's been a champ. It has just the right features for me, stays reasonably accurate and is extremely durable. I've had to replace only two batteries and 3 bands. My one complaint about the band is that the loops don't hold up well. Last week when switching to the count-down alarm function the display froze and the alarm sounded and wouldn't stop. It might have just needed another battery again, but I figured 11 years was a good run so started looking for a new one. So glad to see they're still being sold! Amazon emailed me to expect my new one on Monday.Oh, I hope the new model has a night display with at least a brief delay; sucks to have to use both hands to see the time, especially if you're driving.Timex Men's T77862 Expedition Digital Compass Watch"
0,Bad Inventory,"Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."
0,One Boring Book,"There is no real formatting in this book, just one big slob of text. It is very unreadable and boring"
0,I fail to see what the fuss was all about,"Upon seeing this film on its rerelease, I fail to see what the all the fuss this movie generated was about. Shaky camerawork and the dimly lit foggy environments don't make the film any easier to watch. Hoffman's performance is subdued and reserved and too easily overpowered by the villains' over the top performances. Definately not one of Peckinpah's best, although the film's violence does bear his distinct style."
0,Disappointing,I was expecting to hear the original music from the series; instead I got a souped up orchestral version of the songs in the original series. I was incredibly disappointed. I'm still looking for a CD with the original sounds instead of recreated songs.
0,Read with next to a vomit bag,"These racist women try to justify what was so in your face. OJ was guilty but these women could care less! The book is written for an auidence that would only steal a book not buy one. Whoever thought this book would be a huge seller has to be a bigger fool then the women who wrote it. I hate the fact that they try to justify there verdict. These women I hope one day will speak the truth. The truth is ""We could not convict OJ because my neighbors would cut me up like those white people"".Now I was forced to read this book for a class. It made me sick. This was a racist jury. In the years since this book was released OJ has proven he was no Saint. Most of his lawyers have ended up in some trouble or died. Good. When Johnny Cochraqn died the devil got a new assistant!"
1,Inspiring and factual,"A fantastic account of this man living in Alaska all alone. Most of the book is basically a diary of day to day activites, but if this is interesting to you, you will enjoy it. He built his own cabin 100% by hand, hunted, hiked, and just immersed himself in the outdoors. Very interesting. Its hard to fathom how he did it all."
1,Good belt,"It’s a sturdy 4 inch wide weight lifting belt. I've had it for a few months now and it is holding up and doing its job. For heavy squats, deadlifts, and presses it helps keeps those nasty hernias and testicular micro blood vessel ruptures away. Also provides additional support to my lower back when lifting heavy weights. Its nylon so it’s easy to clean in the washer and the Velcro strip is wide and strong. Works for me, Nuff said!"
0,Better as a decoration than a hub,"If you want a hub to provide a great light show, this is the one. It works, but after one day I bought the Kensington Dome hub--much more useful and better designed."
0,Total Cheddar,"My husband is really into this series of books and wanted to see an adapted interpretation. We turned this off 1/4 of the way through because:1.) It wasn't adapted from the book at all (I did, however, read this in some of the reviews before purchasing)2.) It's a SyFy movie. If you've ever seen one, you know exactly what I mean.3.) The acting is horrid.In defense of the movie, I warned my husband about the perils of SyFy movies, but of course. he didn't listen."
1,A very complete book,"This is a really nice book. It includes extremely detailed information on EVERY mission (TODs 1-3), and winning strategies. Plus the storyline doesn't disappoint. If you fly X-Wing very often, or are in the Rebel Squadrons, then you need this book."
0,you get what you pay for,we've had this toaster oven for a grand total of 2 years and it's already broken. It no longer heats up and is headed for the junk pile. On the back of the oven the cord is frayed where it is connected to the oven. The oven is moved only for cleaning so how can the cord become frayed so quickly? Poor quality is the only reason I can think of. I won't buy this brand again.
1,Good read to walk in obedience,Easy read. Very entertaining. Many christian women will relate to her personal journey. Did not give it 5 stars because I wasn't clear if she had any physical intimacy with her former partners. Would have been nice if it was a little more specific regarding that.
1,Love Blood Ties,"I haven't opened this yet, but don't intend to right now. I have seen all of the episodes on TV, except the las two which I had to watch on the website. I was so disappointed when they took this series off. It was so much better than some that stayed on. Excellent plots, lots of sexual tension, and humor. It is definitely one that you should purchase if you are into vamps."
0,Not For the Drowsy,"This coffee maker is attractive and can make good coffee. Unfortunately, because the interior walls surrounding the heater plate are the precise, dark brown color of coffee, from my angle the carafe always looks empty when it's in the coffee maker. If you're not clear-headed enough to remove and check the carafe every time you make coffee, you'll have messy overflows and ruined pots of coffee."
0,Be very afraid,I give this CD 1 star only because Zero is not an option. This is a typical Gene Simmons piece of junk product that he clearly spent more time on the marketing of this album than on making sure that he had a quality product to market.The self proclaimed genius has failed.....again.Gene owes it to the FANS not to release junk.
0,you gotta be kiddin me...,"i cant believe these other morons' reviews. what the heck are you all thinking??!! this dvd was ABSOLUTE GARBAGE!!! it had NONE of the humor of the ""regular"" ren and stimpy. do yourself a favor, if you liked the ""regular"" ren and stimpy, do not pollute your ideas of the cartoon by watching this garbage! i didnt laugh ONCE! and i laugh at lots of things. i dont see what the heck the ""art"" had to do with the cartoon, it might have been innovative maybe, but this dvd doesnt BEGIN TO COMPARE to the original cartoons! please dont waste your money on this slop! i gave it one star because i couldnt give it ZERO STARS. complete garbage."

1,"Worked great, easy to program","Works perfectly, took about 1 minute to program (most of the time was just used getting a chair to see the code on my opener). Works great no problems at all. I have a very old Stanley opener, but it synched up fine."
0,This unit blows,"Less than a year after I bought it, the thing started cutting out while I was on the phone. The person on the other end of the line couldn't hear me. I sent it back for repair, they did something to it, sent it back to me..............same problem!"
1,panty liners,Hello- I bought this item for my elderly mother and they seem to be working well...she has not complained so life is good! Thanks so much! Nice getting in larger quantities!!!
1,"pleasant, sentimental journey","""On the road"" in Cuba. A nice sentimental journey with lots of traveler's problems to keep it interesting and underscore the harness of traveling in a rather undeveloped country. A pleasant peek into some Cuban lives and that touched on the emotional conflicts in someone (Cuban raised in Miami) who had been detached from his roots.I wish we had seen more variety of the landscape, but still it was good. I also wish that the print had been better and the subtitles more clear, but that was acceptable.I think it stayed away from politics, contrary to some comments here. Cuba was presented as very poor, but there was no blaming either of the US or of the Castro government. It stayed focused on the characters and the atmosphere of the road."
1,Excellent service.,I am pleased with the item and the service. The stockings got a little use after the first wear or two and it felt pretty itchy at some points but other than that it's a great buy. Thanks! I will buy from you again.
0,Could't even finish it!,"I usually devour James Patterson books and I particularly like his collaborations with other authors. Tried as I might, I could not finish this book. I can usually finish his books in a day or two...I would read three pages and have to stop. I got to somewhere in the 200s and decided it's just not worth it. Huge disappointment...but I do recommend The Quickie and You've Been Warned."
0,A pretty book with little useful information.,"If what you're looking for is a nicely designed book with lots of pretty pictures of unusual lampshades, this is a good book. However, if you're looking for practical information on how to make basic lampshades, I suspect you'll be dissapointed. While it does offer how-to's, they apply primarily to the (mostly small) shades pictured (many requiring oddly shaped frames, with no sources for where to get them)."
1,A Secret Affair,I am a Janine Turner fan. Love the settings in Venice and Ireland. Would love to see her do some more great movies!
1,Will all return safely?,"This is the sequel to ""From the Earth to the Moon."" It was first published in 1870 and, although it contains many scientific errors, it also contains some accurate predictions as well. It is perhaps the very first novel to treat travel in space. It was surprisingly fun reading. However, care should be exercised. There are a number of very poor translations available. Make sure yours is fine. In the story, the travelers are unable to land on the moon. They see the ""dark"" side of the moon before they head back to Earth."
0,A WASTE OF TIME & MONEY,This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.
0,"I did not receive it , order cancelled twice",ObviouslyI was better I did not get the book because the scriptures of the bible are taken out of context and interpreted. Secondly what Henry Wright says is not in the bible . I shall not purshase the book.
1,basics of copperplate calligraphy,"In calligraphy, it is important to learn a technique as copperplate because it makes a more well-rounded calligrapher. It is used in addressing envelopes, signing certificates, or any work that uses formal script. This book calls for a Mitchell copperplate pen point and covers basic strokes, minuscules, joining letters, and numerals."
1,Great reading,"Great book. It does clearly explain Yoga as the science which develops the capacity of the human mind to respond to higher vibrations. For a more in debt knowledge on vibrations, check out ""A book about you"" from the same author."

0,This is just horrible.,"I've heard the 'hit' songs from this album and I can't stand them. How can people say this album made them cry? Maybe it would make you cry because it's so god awful, but besides that, I don't know what they were listening to. I think Blink was better back in the day."
1,Smooth Landing,I appreciate the fact that i received this in a timely fashion and fully intact.Nils Wogram continues to impress me w/ those classic euro chops
1,Shame on the seller for outrageous pricing!,It's a shame that this seller is exploiting parents who want to purchase this for their children!!!! This should be considered price gouging!!!! I will search all my Target and Wal-Mart stores before I give a penny to this seller.
1,A Treasure From a Great Storyteller,"Kingsolver is a genius at creating and developing characters. Each one, from the main characters to the old woman we encounter in the motel, is real, multi-dimensional, interesting. You care what happens to them. Her locations have life so her characters can have real experiences there. You can smell the air on a hot night in Arizona just before the rain comes. You can feel the humidity in Kentucky and the aridity in the desert. Best of all, though, is that Kingsolver is a great story teller. She will take you with her on whatever adventure she sets off on with her amazing characters. Sit back, relax. Get ready for a great ride. I envy you just getting started on a Kingsolver story. Have fun!"

0,Another child with a terrible rash,My 19 month old broke out in a terrible red rash after using this lotion. 6 days later and the redness is gone but he still is covered in bumps and uncomfortable. From reading reviews here and on many other sites it seems like a lot of people have had a similar problem. Be careful!
1,Hate to read but I read this in 1 day!,"I would recommend this book to anyone. I guess even for me I learned stuff. I may have a different opinion but it really makes you think about what you believe in, and why you believe the way you do. If you're liberal then you will probably agree with just about everything in the book, and if you like Bill Clinton you will hear alot about him. The book kept my interest and it had several good points even though I didn't agree with everything."
0,Gordon loses his touch and fails to sparkle!,"Bob Gordon has been stealing other people's ideas for some time now, and his latest book is no exception! His ploy is to get others to do all the hard work, then step in and take the credit. He works at Make Believe Ideas in Berkhamsted and came in by the back door, sliming his way up the greasy pole of the publishing world. Don't believe him, he is a charlatan!"

0,Humbug!,"Thomas Harris wrote THIS? Oh God... this is a blatant romance and melodrama, served as a splatterpunk dish with a glass of gore. It does not approach the mastery of Red Dragon. It is not even as good as Silence of the Lambs - it is simply a bad novel. Eleven years of waiting for THIS?????"
0,Waste of money!!,"This thing is a waste of paper, it doesn't give u any better reception. This is a total rip off in my book :-("
0,For hobbyists only,"My ""garden"" is a balcony, 11 floors up, and I figured that a container gardening guide from Brooklyn would be just the thing for a city gardener like me. Alas, no. The book mainly features chapters by enhusiasts about their particular kicks: alpine gardening, classic (i.e., Greek-inspired) containers, etc. Yes, there's a final chapter with practical gardening advice about soil and plant care, but it's pretty generic. Unless you share the authors' specific passions, buy another guide."
1,Greywater Guide,"Good general reference for planning a greywater system. Especially like the section on systems that don't work. Nice not to have to reinvent the wheel. Information in the book correlates well with my own experiences with greywater over the last 30 years in various parts of the world. A ""must have"" reference for anyone considering installing a greywater system."
0,murder of Alice,"I bought the book without realizing that this is a ""retelling"". I read first few chapters to my son and it felt very strange - the story was not funny or witty or engaging. None of the humor and charming wierdness I remember from reading this book when I was a child. Then it dawned on me that I was reading an abridged version. The story is totally butchered; reading it gives me tooth pain. I got myself an orognal Alice and all is well again - now I remeber why this is a great classic and a joy to read.The illustrations are great. One star for the text. Awful."

I've now observed her playing the game (as much as her mom will allow - 1 hour per day - smart, that daughter of mine!) and she is having fun as well as learning about geography, travel manners, planning, culture and patience (just wait until she meets the TSA... :)I rate this highly as a gift item based on her enthusiasm in playing it (she even shares with her younger brother) and the fact that I actually received a THANK YOU note!"
0,meh performance,"I tried out the 80 grit pad for a couple of minutes and the disk was almost used up in this time spent on my DA. The dust collection holes are placed properly and allow most of the dust to be collected in my filter bag. They work almost as well as my cheap ones from Harbor Freight, but that isn't saying really. I would not buy these again as they have such a short lifespan and the fact that I have picked up 100 sanding pads from HF recently for just $4 plus tax. I will update as I use more sanding disks over time."
1,Almost at the top of my movie meter.,"I watched this at a party with my friend. It was hysterical! We laughed more than a gazillion times. Dana Carvey was fit for the part of Pistachio Disguisey. And the crude humor was awesome man!But the only reason I am rating this movie four stars is because it needed some more pure action and adventure. If Revolution Studios is going to make a sequel (And I sure hope they do!) It has to has some more pure action and adventure! I know I'm dragging this down with all these complaints on one subject all a little too much. Bottom Line: It was a great movie! Keep the crude humor,keep Dana Carvey,keep the laughing out of your body disguises! Just put in some pure action and adventure PLEASE!"
0,Too Slow and Over Written!,"I found the first 300 pages of this book to be so slow and over written, which wouldn't be so bad if one of these characters we likeable but they are so prentious and self involved.That being said Franzen does make some poigant observations about family dynamics."
1,Saved my kids from so many infections,"This kids remedy is very effective and my kids like its taste, the key to harnessing its power is to use it at the first signs of the infection, it then has a very good chance of stopping that illness before it is too strong. I some time use it as a precautionary measure before taking my kids to crowded places like airports."
1,Heavy Weight,I bought this sheet set based on reviews about a month ago. I am pleased so far. The depth of the bottom sheet even after three washings is more than adequate for our deep mattress. The Top sheet however seems a little short and certainly cannot be comfortably tucked in all the way around.The sheets are definitely heavy weights. The top sheet more than satisfies as a light blanket. I look forward to the set getting softer with age and washing.
0,dullest,The blade I bought was quite dull. Then I contacted Customer Service all I am qetting with them is the run around..BEWARE!!
0,I couldn't get thru it either,"Although highly motivated, I got through about 30 pages before quitting. I loved other Henry James, so this one must be just too difficult."
0,A Great Deal of Effort,It is obvious that a great deal of effort went into writing this book. Unfortunately it is heavy-handed without much substance.Also the author seems to have a personal chip on his shoulder so it is not very objective.
1,ONE OF THE BEST PIKE BOOKS!!!,"This one one of my favorite Books bu Christopher Pike. The Plot is excellent and the story is so gripping that i couldn't put it down.It's all about a girl named Mary who goes into a pary and kills two people. She tries to kill more but gets arrested. When her friend Angela visits her in jail the next day, she says she killed them because they were no longer human. Angela eventually becomes friends with one of the people Mary tries to kill, but after a while strange things start to happen, and Angela investigates further into Mary's claim. Then she discovers whats really going on. It is a but gory so some people might not want to read it, but for the rest of you, I strongly recomned this!"
1,This CD is the bomb,This is one of the best cds I have ever listened too. The songs are easy to like. I liked semi charmed life the best.
0,"mediocre humidifier, but easily available locally","This is a mediocre humidifier at best, I only bought it because it was at my local CVS and I needed one at that moment. It is not easy enough to clean, it does not humidify well, it is louder than it should be; I will continue to research and try to find a better one."
0,Nice until they break,The high G string broke after about 30 days. This happened during tuning. Too late to return so I`ll probably try another brand

1,Great Stickiness!,I used this tape for a different purpose than auto. I cut it into smaller pieces and wrapped it around my dog's harness and leash so he could be seen while we run. It was very effective and really catches the light!
0,Horrible - dont buy it,"First - I bought this for 10dollars at toysrus. Second - my son, myself - everyone was so excited to get this toy - and we were soo disappointed!! It takes an engineering degree to change it from the car to the autobot and forget about back again. Parts come flying off (although they are easily reattached) and it NEVER i repeat NEVER looks the same once you change it from one form to another - my son could not even use it as a car because the tires dont easily align. A waste of money and excitement."
1,Enjoyable,"Ms. Christian has created a vivid and enjoyable story. The plot was predictable, but nontheless made for a good read."
1,Great Product!,"I was looking for a home micro dermabrasion product, and after reading reviews for the Ponds decided to try it. I love the way it makes my skin feel, and have seen great improvement using it 2-3 times weekly for just two weeks!The reason I only gave it a four star rating is because of the little polishing tool that comes with it. Once my hands are wet it's hard to hold on to (I use it when I'm in the shower) because the handle is so small. I just use my fingers to apply and massage. Overall, though, the product itself is great and I will purchase again once I've used my supply!"
1,This is for Zack,"Zack your a retarted fool...as if all your ""prestigous"" thoughts sound great on the screen.... speak english it's plain and simple--this album is beyond great....you don't have to go into cockass mode and ruin it by killing the beauty of this album--"
1,Good Stuff,"I have 4 children and use a lot of arnica. The faster you put it on, the better the effect. I've put it on goose eggs on their heads immediately after the injury and within an hour can't see a bruise at all. My 2yo got her elbow pinched in a stroller hinge...no bruising after the arnica. My husband had a bad landing when parachuting the other day and hurt his ankle. He said the arnica was amazing. He's now carrying a tube in his pocket. :) Highly recommend this stuff."
0,Misleading,"I bought this ""book"" for my wife and we discovered it isn't a book at all, but rather a fold out paper poster. I should have been tipped off when I saw the price was $4.00. It truly isn't worth the 4.00 I paid for it and it should NOT be described as a book."
0,Some disturbing images/sounds for very young children,"I bought this video for my two-year-old, who loves elephants. And he does love this video, but doesn't like to watch it alone. First, there are a couple of graphic shots of dead elephants. Then, there are some dramatic sound effects and intimidating angles of elephants' feet coming down. Also, one shot shows a man (in a studio), aiming a rifle at an elephant, and shooting. The elephant disappears, so we don't see the animal dying. Still, our son has focussed on that, talking about people shooting elephants. The bottom line is, it's an excellent video for older children, but I don't recommend it for the very, very young."
1,the best shoes in the world!,"this shoe is wonderfully comfortable! it is like walking on a mattress. your feet never get tired, even with my permanently injured ankle, i can walk all day. since my injury these are the only shoes i can wear. if you normally wear a wide width, order a medium width because they run wider. the heel height is just right, not too low, not too high. i am sure you will love this shoe!"
0,Problems with Kindle edition of a wonderful book,"This is a fabulous book by an author who is sadly underrated. However, the Kindle edition had chunks of text out of sequence. Buy the paperback. It will be a classic."
1,Little cricket,"It was better than I thought, the person I gave it to for Christmas really liked it.I'm thinking about another one."
0,Unhelpful for binge eaters,"I have been a food addict for years now, and I was looking for a step-by-step recovery plan to help me. This book is terrible and the suggestions are completely ridiculous. For example, Kay Sheppard says not to use iodized salt because it contains sugar. This is blatantly untrue--check the label of any salt container yourself. Furthermore, her ""abstinent"" meal plan recipes include potato salad and blueberry muffins--total binge foods for just about anyone!"
1,Bo Rocks,10 times better now that he has the backing to make an outstanding cd.Can't wait for his full length cd this fall.Everything was very polished and full of energy.He was truly the American Idol.
1,At The Blackhawk V3,Great Jazz combo CD. Any of the 5 volumes of At The Blackhawk are worth getting and this is no exception. A must for a well rounded Jazz collection.
1,Great little learning watch,It is a great little learning watch for small children. The strap is not as well made as one would expect.
1,A Thoughtful Approach to Prayer,"Since reading ""The Jesus I Never Knew"", Philip Yancey has been one of my favorites. He challenges me to leave the predictable approach to Christianity and to look at things from an open-minded approach. In this book, he tackles the often written about subject of prayer in the same manner. He asks, ""Does it Matter?"", when we all know it does. He looks at the ways that prayer is often misunderstood and the ways that it changes us and the situations around us."
1,great!,"Excellent! uplifting and spiritually fulfilling read! Dannah Gresh is great - I would also highly recommend her ""5Questions that Reveal the Life that God designed for me"""
1,Barbara's a Surprise,"The cookies are a snack provided to employees, we're trying to keep it relatively healthy but tasty. Was hoping this wasn't another disappointment for lower sugar cookie. It's a pleasant surprise, good chocolate taste, not chalky or dry. It was requested in another flavor, in addition to the Double Chocolate."
1,The Original & BEST version!,"The Nutty Professor is one of Jerry Lewis's best films and never mind Eddie Murphy's version, Jerry puts Eddie to shame with his hilarious dual role! A must-have for Lewis fans and anyone who just enjoys plenty of belly laughs!"
1,Excellent Hard Drive Tray,"Having spare Hard Drive Trays for myICY DOCK MB559US-1S External 3.5"" eSATA/USB 2.0 Hard Drive Enclosureis really nice. No more fiddling with those tiny screws when I want to change drives. I just pull the old drive out and put the already mounted new drive in. My only complaint with this is that it's a bit pricey. But, still, I rate it at an Excellent 5 stars out of 5."
1,Hijinks in jeans,"The Miracle Life of Edgar Mint is a frustratingly page turner where little Edgar attracts different kinds of trouble(s). For me, it was very real, as the setting is where I was born and raised. The story is fictional but some of the events are real. I am glad that Brady Udall was able to write in a humorous way, about these marginalized people(s). The novel was recommended by a friend and now I am recommending this story to other friends."
0,The bottles may be indestructible......,"The bottles are sturdy, strong, and don't give water that plastic taste that makes you gag. However, the lid broke less than a month after I had the bottle. I ordered two of these and they broke. Very poor quality in the lid. Skip this for a better quality item."
0,shit,"I'm sorry, but this music quite honestly scares the fuc**n sh*t out of me. it's absolute noise and nothing deeper than that."
0,Horrible Gun,This gun is horrible. The scope is a pain to put on and its Completly inaccurate. The directions for the gun are also horrible. They just give you pictures and expect you to put it together. Well you get what you paid for. If you really want an airsoft gun you should go to another web site to order another gun because this gun is made in China and they make cheap guns (im sorry but thats not racisim)
1,"New ""old"" John Prine is terrific!","He re-recorded these songs in April of 2000 -- and it's great hearing his mature voice singing these classic songs.Overall his delivery is the same as always (no radical revisions), it's just that his voice is older.Play it loud at home -- it's like he's come over to your house to sing you his best songs.How terrific!"
1,A Wonderful Resource for all Women,"This is an excellent and thourougly interesting book written in a light and humorous tone. It gives informative, solid advice on how (or how not to) get pregnant, but beyond that, it's just a wonderful read if you want to know more about your body. It goes into great detail about anatomy, cycles and hormones, and while you may think you know about all that, you probably don't know half as much as you think you do! Obviously, you're not guaranteed to get pregnant if you follow the author's advice, but I did and I am (after two cycles charting!), and I am grateful to the many friends who told me to read this book"
1,I still have goosebumps..Grudge 2 rocks!!,"I never write movie reviews, but had to let everyone know what a profound effect this had on me. This is an excellent sequel to The Grudge. It keeps you on the edge of your seat from the very beginning up to the last frame. The film was directed perfectly and the music score was super.For those of you who had written bad reviews, sorry...the curse is now with YOU!!!See this one as it is on my top 10 list."
1,an exclusive item that you should have,"we've looked for an carrier since our baby borned. my sister-in-law has baby bjorn, they were saying it was great. when i tried on infantino eurorider...it is so comfortable and my son wasn't crying when i put him into carrier(my son was crying when i put him into my sis-in-law's baby bjorn). it is great item to purchased, and is highly recommanded."
1,The Amazing Mr. Laine!,"Forget that Frainkie Laine was 85 when he recorded this cd. It is terrific at any age! His voice has held up remarkably well. There are 50 and 60 year olds who can't touch him!He performs SONG OF INDIA as well as it can be done and his take on the title cut is bravura; strong, touching and virile. Some tracks will appeal more than others of course, yet there is not a bad track on the CD.This CD is available if you search for it. Do it! As these legends depart they will not be replaced and Laine (may he go on forever) is truly a marvel."
0,Just Terrible. Terrible. Terrible.,"I was kind of disappointed in the film. It was Ok, but it needed more better graphic shark attacks and better acting if you ask me. Spilberg's JAWS was way better that Deep Blue Sea. Why bothing going through the trouble making another horrible film? All it's about is these three sharks that these scientist reseachers are studying on to make them get ""smarter."" Suddenly, the sharks escape and start terrorizing the people. If you ask me, don't bother seeing this movie. If you want to see a shark movie, diffinatly see JAWS."
0,Somewhat Disappointing . . .,"I've been a fan of the BET Celebration of Gospel production's from their inception. But the for sale version of this one left me feeling cheated. They cut some very desirable performances by Yolanda Adams (featuring the ever-smooth Doc Powell) and Israel Houghton (featuring T-Bone, who burned it up that night) from the original taping. They also cut Steve Harvey's hosting spots. What's up BET? A disclaimer would have been appreciated."
1,this book was okay,"after reading 3 original smallville books, i am beginning tothink that the story does not translate well into print. this story tells of a man who committed murder 12 years ago and finally gets out and has the notion that he will come clean and do well in the world. but smallville is not known for normal life. he comes back to smallville, is exposed to the meteroites,and his life and the life of the town is never quite the same. this story does have some interesting hereos and a couple of plottwist, but like xena, the books never seem to come close to the tv show that we all love. hopefully some of the future books arebetter written and give us hope to look for new titles."
1,For information on measurements,I wasn't able to find any information anywhere online about the diameter on these strainers so I finally just went to ace hardware and measured them myself in the store. I thought I'd share in case other want to know as well:The smallest one is 2 1/4 inch in diameter. The inner opening where the basket dips is 3/4 inch in diameter.The medium size is 2 3/4 inch in diameter. The inner basket diameter is about 1 inch.The largest one is 4 1/2 inch in diameter. The inner diameter is about 2 inch.--My drain is 2 1/4 inches in diameter and I found the large one works perfectly. I tried the small and medium ones too but is slid around too much in the drain--
1,Anne of Green Gables ...again and again,This movie is magical and wonderful all the way up to the tearjerking end. Love and fun and wit and learning. If you don't cry at the end your dead!
0,Too superficial ...,Not impressed!! The lessons taught here are not something new but they are so superficially presented.
0,Is Manning Catholic?,"The book offers up an unoriginal feminist critique of what the Catholic Church teaches. It is predictable from the first to last page.The oddest thing about the book is that the author claims that John Paul II doesn't understand Catholic teaching. She doesn't appear to realize that the teachings of John Paul II simply update the Church's longstanding (and unchangeable) position on ordination, contraception, and abortion. She seems to think that these positions are just this Pope's mysterious pet theory and that a puff of white smoke can change anything.One can only contrast the balanced, hopeful tone of John Paul II's Letter to Women with the bitter, angry tone of this entire book.Sad."
0,Can you say FULL BLOWN CRAP!,"full blown chaos are a horrible band AT BEST. The lead singer has no range at all and every song sounds like the previous, these guys are Hatebreed wannabes. If you want a real metal cd get Darkest Hours new one ""undoing ruin"", it is so much better than this garbage. GOOD JOB FULL BLOWN MONOTONE!"
0,"ehh, usefull but could be much better","Okay so this little item was cheap but....Pros:Heavy duty metal in stakes.Nice little removal tool.Cons:Plastic heads on stakes spin and slide on stake shafts. (They don't feel like they will last very long)Bag is mesh and the broom gets stuck when putting it in or out,a pain.Only 4 stakes. (I know, I know that is what is pictured. But if your buying a tent at the same time it might catch you off guard. Just sayin...)Hammer kind of on the lighter side. (If you have hard surface might be a problem)I would just go buy stakes at the store next time."

1,The Oregon Trail!,I read this book for a book report and my teacher loved it so much she read it to the class! It is a great book that tells about the life of a young boy on his dangerous and thrilling journey on the Oregon Trail! READ THIS BOOK!
1,As described,bought for my son who needed this book for english. Item as described. and served its purpose. I haven't typed enough.
0,Crappy hardware,"The cable is just fine and its a hard to find length, however, the eye-bolts provided with this set both snapped *As I was screwing them into 4x4 southern yellow pine posts that were fairly weathered*. The spring also doesn't look like it would handle any real tug by our 70 lb. hound.This is what happens when a company doesn't have the ethical backbone to spend 50 cents extra for decent steel and hardware to ensure your dog doesn't break loose and run off.Do not buy this product. Buy coated cable and go to the local hardware store and buy decent hardware and do it yourself, its pretty easy."
1,Wonderful Value!!!,"I bought 2 of these for my son since they were only pennies a piece, with shipping it came to $6. I would have paid $10 in store for just 1 used one! And since my son is so good at losing power cords I figurd I would get 2 for that price. They both work and no problems. I was somewhat surprised given the fact that they were like 10 cents a piece! Grab a few at this price if you are smart!"
0,What's the Logic Behind...,"I do not understand why Chess has an absolutely wonderful vinyl record and CHOP IT UP to make a CD? Why on earth would they fade out LONG DISTANCE CALL at the very climax at the end? It makes no sense, they could fit almost twice the content, so space isn't the answer.Is there a CD version that includes the entire, uncut ""LONG DISTANCE CALL"" as it was on the vinyl release?"
0,"sadly, I am not impressed","Ditto. I am not impressed. This is an OK coffee, but no more than that, while, say, Davidoff Coffee that Amazon sells also, being much superior, excells in taste in quality... I am a Davidoff fan now. Never again, Mount Hagen! Get lost!"
1,Great fencing book,I asked for a fencing book that would give me the complete history of fencing as well as techniques and it looks like I got one. Thank you so much.
0,buy a different one,"The recipes are only 20 minutes worth of prep if you happen to have all of her odd and exotic ingredients on hand, particularly spices. I would have to wait for the mail order spices to arrive or visit a gourmet store a few hours away.The recipes also include a lot of pizza and omelettes, things that are probably in every other vegetarian cookbook, or even Betty Crocker. I bought this along with the Italian Vegetarian cookbook two months ago. I use the Italian one regularly and haven't used Rose Elliot's book once."
0,Poor Printing,"The company's service was good, but the book itself was full of printing errors. A large speech was absent at the end, and I caught that only because I'd looked it up; the ending made no sense without it. There was also computer code on the pages here and there in the middle of text. I definitely don't recommend this publisher's version of the book."
1,warm and quiet,"This space heater is nice and toasty, small and lightweight. It is definitely for personal space heating though; I don't think it would heat a room. Overall very satisfied with product."
0,THIS Product does not work at all?,NO sound does not work at all?must be defective right out of the box!Had a BELKIN for several years and it worked fine this did not work from day one!
1,Virtually Flawless.,"This band has put out a hardcore album worthy of being deemed virtually flawless. .... With great effort i have found only one thing this cd lacks, breakdowns. Those who love unearth, norma jean (formerly luti-kriss), underoath, falling cycle, throwdown, eighteen visions and sinai beach, will not be used to the lack of breackdowns. But if you love blistering speed, great vocals, and mindblowingly intricate music, you will no doubt fall in love with Every Time i Die."
1,"Great product, great price.",I purchased this for my husband for a great low price. I received the prouduct in excellent condition very quickly..Would order again.
0,horrible,"This is the first time I've ever refused to finish a book. After Justin practially rejoices at his brother's death, he goes off an rapes the guy's wife. It just made me so mad I had to stop where I was. I like Lisa Kleypas, but I have to say this is her WORST book."
0,Not very strong,"Although attractive, this fan was not very strong. For the price, I expected something that had more oomph. In the summer, I'm sure the water container part would be nice...but...you need a fan that delivers a solid breeze. This is not it."

0,Can't hear anything!!!,I like how the ear piece fits into your ear but you can't hear anything AT ALLLL!!!! I am very disappointed and mad that I waisted money on a product that doesn't perform well. What am I going to use it for If I can't hear out of it. I have used other earpiece and they have been much more powerful then this one.
0,Dissapointed,"The grill cooks fine, but stains easily. Initially I used it to heat tortillas and make quesadillas. Wherever something burned, there are spots that cannot be removed by soaking or scrubbing with brillo pads. Although the grill is still usable, it is not presentable and I cannot take it from stove to table-top as the item description suggested."
1,Nothing Could be Finer...,"I recently found Walking Across Egypt while helping my 86 year old Mom clear out some old books. After reading it I had to move on to the next in the series, ""Killer Diller"". Set in North Carolina, Clyde Edgarton really catches the flavor of the south in developing this delicious cast of charachters. Easy reading that takes me away from stressful L.A. to the front porch of a slower paced lifestyle with laughs along the way. Walking Across Egypt [WALKING ACROSS EGYPT] [Mass Market Paperbound]"
1,Etymotic ER6i Isolator In-Ear Earphones,"I use these headphones for medical transcription and they are wonderful for the noise-isolation feature. Apparently, I have small ear canals and they do hurt my ears, even with the smallest tips on. In that respect, they are not comfortable at all, but would probably be great for someone without this problem."
0,whoa this is odd,"i was surprised, this cd was a big disapointment. comapred to leaving thru the window its really crappy. thats being generous"
1,This CD is Amazing!,"If you want a sample of what the Be Bop Deluxe was all about, this is the CD to get. Interestingly enough, Bill Nelson has been actively releasing CD since the Be Bop Deluxe called it quits.I am a fan of many of the 70's UK rock bands (T. Rex, Bowie, Cocknet Rebel to name a few) and had heard of the Be Bop Deluxe and Bill Nelson, but never sought out their recordings until now. This my first sample of the group's output. I'm amazed at what I missed out on: Great guitar playing, sonic soundscapes, and wonderful lyrical imagry. I found every song on the CD enjoyable and will be seeking out the band's outher CDs to fill in the gaps this complilation doesn't cover.This album brings you the highlights from ""Axe Victim,"" ""Futurama,"" ""Sunburst Finish,"" ""Live in the Air Age,"" ""Modern Times,"" and ""Drastic Plastic""."
1,Medium is medium,"I have had several pairs of these gloves over the years and have used them primarily for gardening. While they are sturdy, they do not allow for you to pick up small item given its rather bulky built. And finally, a medium is no doubt a medium (8.5 in European sizing); if you have long fingers, stay away!"
1,good,"work good. easy enough to install. Would like a little more light output, but it's still pretty good."
1,Awesome Repaint!,"I know a lot of Transformers fans hate repaints, but I'm not one of them. I like a lot of the repaints, and, in my opinion, THIS ONE ROCKS! Great repaint of an already cool toy! I haven't transformed Energon Unicron yet (it's tricky; I could do it, but it's not worth the trouble when he's so much more fun in robot mode!), but his robot mode kicks butt! While I certainly enjoyed the Armada Unicron (especially since his paint job matched the Movie version), I like this one better. The cool neon green, orange, & black make him more menacing a make for a much cooler looking toy. He has MAJOR articulation (wish he could bring his hand to his mouth, though, so I could pretend he's devouring TFs like in the Movie or issue #75 of the Marvel comic book, though.). One of the best TFs ever, and, either in its Armada or Energon version, worth getting! BTW, the Energon version may be hard to find, because A LOT of Energon Unicron boxes have the Armada Unicron packed inside instead."
0,"Looks good, but not much fun...","At first, I got excited that it doesn't require any batteries, as we use a lot of them in our house. But after we got the gun and tried it out, we quickly became disappointed with it. It is very VERY hard to blow bubbles out of it. You have to pull on that trigger for a long time until ANYTHING comes out. And most of the time it's the solution, not bubbles, the solution just runs out of the barrel. VERY hard to form bubbles with this gun for an adult, not to mention a 3,5-year-old kid. And keep in mind, it's 1 bubble at a time! You spend a minute working the trigger and then, if you're lucky, you'll get ONE bubble. So, it's a disappointment. I would recommend to invest in a battery-operated automatic bubble blower, that blows a lot of bubbles at once."
1,Good quality,"item was better than exspected, seen this movie as a kid and now my grandsons are able to enjoy it."
0,Into the trash!,I just threw this product in the trash. It does help BUT it flakes and makes my eyes red and itchy.
1,Hijinks in Hawaii,"In the Navy is the story of a bunch of guys who are, well, in the Navy! It stars Abbott and Costello, a great comedy team. Throughout the film they manage to get into scuffles with girls, officers, each other, and even inanimate objects, making a truly funny film. A sub-story revolves around a singing star (Dick Powell) who attempts to live a normal life by joining the Navy under his real name. A reporter follows him around trying to get a photo to break through into the journalism business.This film has a great cast. Apart from the hilarious Bud and Lou and the adorable Powell, the Andrews sisters appear as entertainers for the boys. Some of their songs are cute and entertaining, but they prove to be somewhat annoying throughout. Shemp Howard of Three Stooges fame has a small part as a dishwasher too.Overall, this is not an important film or one of genius, but it is terribly entertaining and fun for all ages."
1,A Must Get,"This game is so cool because you have tons of guns, ammo, cool missions, and lots of humor in the videos. This is so awesome. This is a must get. Oh, for you parents, this is rated ""T"" for mild violence, which in this case is the guns and maybe the killing the bad guys. But this is clean otherwise. Please get it."
1,Knock Out Jam,Sparkle truly shines on this R.Kelly Track that He Wrote&Produced.they truly had some strong Musical Chemistry going on&this track Showcases Sparkle really well.
1,A great 45 minute movie lies within...,"After being subjected to post-modern horror for years, where movies were afraid to just be scary without winking at the audience, we have here, ladies and gentlemen, the scariest 45 minutes of film to come along in AGES.The first half of this movie is so full of dread. Superbly done. The rest of the movie...eh. Once we see the creature, it kinda falls apart. But I forgive them...especially since the last 10 seconds made my stomach drop.Again I shake my head in disbelief at people who toss this movie aside. Probably same folks who poo-pooed ""Suspiria"" and ""Blair Witch""...just WHAT do they define as ""scary""???"
0,"nice illustrations, choppy story","Like two other Janell Cannon books Stellaluna and Verdi, Trupp has great illustrations. That is only one element of the importance of children's picture books -- the STORY is really the main event that sparks imaginations and opens those priceless discussions. Trupp did not do that for us.As others here have pointed out, Trupp kind of meanders pointlessly on a journey that ends rather abruptly. The moral of the story is compassion and kindness to the homeless. I felt that this message was a little obvious and heavyhanded; it almost substituted for an actual storyline. In the end, Trupp: a Fuzzhead Tale comes across as bland and preachy.There are not a lot of children's picture books out there that address the homeless, and for that I must give Cannon credit for trying to touch on the subject."
1,"They're good bottles, but DO NOT BOIL THEM","We searched the entire country for bottles that aren't made of polycarbonate (PC) plastic, which contains bisphenol A, a compound known to be estrogenic. The only bottles in the US (besides glass, which isn't an option for us) that aren't made of PC were these, which are made of polypropylene (PP). They are good bottles and the nipples (silicone) work well for our son (age 3 mos). The only problem, and the reason I gave it four stars, is that the lid where you insert the nipple can warp if you boil it for sterilization, and then there can be major leakage around where the nipple should seal. This is a function of its being PP instead of the tougher PC plastic. So, soap and water on the lids! You can boil the silicone nipples."

1,A Classic for Amateurs,"This high quality and well written book will certainly join Burnhams three volume set as a long term classic, for those wanting to explore the sky with binocs. The numerous drawings and charts are priceless in locating interesting objects. It's a pity this excellent book is listed as ""buy it used"" by Amazon, with none shown as available used, since mine arrived spanking new in three days from Richmond to Maine via UPS in a highly professionally wrapped box for only a... handling fee and zero shipping charges from Willman-Bell the publisher. The inclusion of the outstanding Tirion Star Atlas is a huge plus, highly useful with only the naked eye, as well as with binocs and small telescopes. A Best Buy for anyones library. When you or the children in the family are ready to go beyond Rey's priceless ""The Stars-A New Way to See Them"", this book should come next."
0,HORRIBLE PET TOY,"I ordered this toy for my 2 year old labrador and she managed to chew off the handle in less than 10 minutes! How is it that a toy made for a ""Large to X-Large Dog"" can be destroyed in such a short amount of time? I contacted the company, but no response. I DO NOT recommend this toy for any dog over 30lbs."
0,A Tough Slog,"Having read The Making of Kind Of Blue just previous to this book, and seeking an insight into Bill Evans, I was quickly disappointed by the academic approach to this book. I'm not a pianist and I don't read music, though I am a musician, and the dry details of every gig and recording were little more stimulating than the reading out loud of a schedule book, in my opinion. The sheer volume of names, sometimes dozens to a page, was mind-numbing--even though I recognized every one.Music is best appreciated when listened to, not read about, so in my opinion this book deserves to be on the high and dusty shelves of a conservatory library rather than on my shelf next to the dynamic biographies of Miles Davis and yes, Elton John--books that really gave me an insight into the people behind the music."

0,Previews that never end.,"This is a great DVD to buy if you want to watch previews, because apparently there's no way to skip them. I recommend you rent this first, so you know what you're in for. Then, when you discover you can't watch the movie you actually got the DVD to see, you can send it back without losing any money beyond what it cost to rent.I don't understand what goes on in the heads of Disney executives who think that when consumers sit down to watch a movie, they first want to watch a lot of advertisements. Especially when those advertisements come on every damn time they want to watch the movie."
1,OOOOOOOMMMMM LOVELY OOOOOOOOOOOMMMMMMMM,"TRAVELLING THE SACRED SOUND CURRENT is the CD companion of the optional purchase study book of the same name. I have not read the companion book or know anything about Deborah Van Dyke's teaching. What I do know is that the CD can serve as the musical component for high level meditation/visualization. I also have played it as an ambient, atmospheric background. The results have been the same. It works. The music & sounds definitely seem to clear the air (so to speak) and impart a gentle serenity. TRAVELLING really delivers as far as facilitating meditation/vidualization--even without knowledge of the teacher or her methods. Now I'm curious to read the book--or watch the DVD if there's one available.If I were to place TRAVELLING THE SACRED SOUND CURRENT in a genre, it would be mantra & cultural fusion--my favorite musical expression.There is a lovely photo of Deborah Van Dyke standing at the seashore on the CD. She certainly radiates tranquilty & happiness."

1,So much life packed in such a short life,"This book is thorough in its coverage and brings to life the amazing story of Ben-Yehuda. While reading you cannot help being in awe of his steadfast determination and prophetic vision of the future. The author of the biography is also a big fan of Ben-Yehuda. It did feel that while factually the biography was probably quite accurate, the heated debates and controversies surrounding Ben-Yehuda's life received rather one-sided coverage."
1,Very Entertaining,"Although non fiction with a known ending, it was well written and tells the story well. It is MUCH better than the Hollywood-ized movie ""Bottle Shock"" based on this book. Recommended."
0,only one good song,"I thought this cd would be good because I like the song soft, but that was not the case. The songs are just not heavy enough."
1,Missing Something?,"This has all of their greatest songs on it, I loved Dru Hill when they were out. They were almost on the level of Boys II Men (had they managed to stay together long enough)....BUT...I always thought that Jazz was the best singer. My favorite songs were Never Make A Promise and 5 Steps. Well.....if you buy the CD for either of those songs, be prepared....5 Steps cuts out half of Jazz's verse. The part that goes ""and what was reality once, a love tru in form, is now added pain, to a man scorned....."" any one else noticed that about that part? It's just....gone....otherwise I loved the CD.Although, I hate that they added anything from the newly formed group that had 5 members. I hate that new guy. He completely threw the sound, the melody, the HARMONY off....lol but it's worth getting for all but the last two.Last note...DARN YOU SISQO for messing up the group! I hope the ""Thong Song"" made all the money you hoped it would!!!!!"
0,SOFT TOYS TO SEW,"we would like to buy the lot of books for soft toys making design our address saral typing Lily chowk, Raipur (M.P.) India. Plese arrange to sent the books and condition for payment. suggest How to send the payment."
0,"Predictable, boring, flat",This book was awful. Her characters are too flat and unrealistic. Her dialogue is stilted and her plot is unbelievable. Her sucess and multitudes of positve reviews is baffling.
0,High shipping charges,"My comments are the same as other customer / reviewer - the item is $2 and shipping is $10. Product is fine, but to have a shipping charge of 5 times the retail cost seems silly."
0,I've got a real problem with this movie...,"So, (spoiler alert) the sun is going out and the people on the spaceship are going to restart it and save the earth. They have a lot of challenges to overcome like in any movie, and then they overcome them. But here's the thing about the movie that you won't believe: no one ever looks really serious and says ""It's daylight saving time.""Not one character. No one says ""It's daylight saving time."" In the entire movie. I know you don't think it's possible, but if you watch it you'll feel like you wasted 4 hours of your life (time moves slower when you're waiting for someone to deliver an amazing line). What were the writers thinking!?"
0,Better left untold stories for your kitschy heart,"I've tried to read Solnit over the years but her disjointed view of the ecological and other problems facing the US-- and past critiques of how to solve them-- just hang there, like a phantom in the dark, as I read.In past works she's vehemently against WALMART, but for the 'latinoization' of the US' as a way of reinjecting political serum into the body politic. Rebecca, where do you think a lot of latinos--legal land illegal--work and shop to help break U.S. consumer consumption records?She's against the 'racists' in the Sierra Club who want stricter immigration control, yet she's silent on the 'no-longer a white elephant' population issue that's helping to destroy her beloved West.If you can get over the twice-chewed romantic stories of 'hope' in this one, you may find possibilities in this book. I found a yawner."
1,THIS ALBUM IS NOT COPY PROTECTED,"I was the recording engineer for the album and I Just want to repeat what has been posted several times, this CD is NOT copy protected. Use it on your MP3 player and have a Merry Christmas........"
0,Don't do it!!,"Stay away from this game. Leave it in the bargain bin, don't consider buying it online. In the modern era of games, this doesn't even show up on the radar as a possibility of something you should buy. I can name a few hundred games that are better than this one, and that's just off the top of my head. I actually did put in a little time trying to play this before I traded it in, but I can't tell you too much about it. As a matter of fact, there's probably not too many people who could tell you, as I couldn't imagine anyone suffering through the full campaign."
1,A keeper!,"If you only can buy one Passover book for your two through six year old, this should be it. The book has more pages than most board books and is a very good value for the money. It tells the story of Passover (many children's books do not) as well as talking about customs and traditions most Jewish children will see. One of the best thing about this series is that it uses faces of real children (ages 5 to 6 approximately) to depict the characters in the book,therefore, making it very eye-appealing to readers. There is something in the book for very young children as well as early readers."
1,Bear Stays Up For Christmas,"I purchased this book for my son after receiving the Bear Snores On as a gift. They are his absolute favorites. The pictures are beautiful and the words are lyrical and rhyming. I also like the way it subtly includes both the religious and secular sides of Christmas beneath the overall message of friendship and giving. He has MANY books, but wants me to read this one every night. It's so nice I din't mind."
1,we use standard deviants as fun review and study material,"We understand others frustrations in their purchase of Standard Deviant...the company should have put ""study and review"" along with ""learn"" on their package. We'll never forget now (we learn from others mistakes) that Mexico etc... is in North America now will we! As for the jokes, some may be ""over the heads"" of 8 and under folks but so is Bugs Bunny and Dr. Seuss. We absolutely love and actually do learn from those corny guys!"
1,wish it was more peanut,I ordered this since I wanted variety but almost wish they put in more peanut and took out something else. Price ok for this product
1,Single greatest Punk/Hardcore album ever!,"Discharge's HEAR NOTHING SEE NOTHIG SAY NOTHING was my first punk/hardcore album and absolutly loved it. It was so differant to what i listened to before but it made me want to learn more about this kind of music. It is so brutal that words can't describe it, all you have to do is listen and hear the anger from these chaps and be consumed by their wall of sound.Probably the most angry album i'v listened to in my life."
0,NO hot air after used for 6 months,"Can't believed, only 6 months, only cold air now, totally no heat come out, dead so easily of this blow-dryer. Total disappoint that from Amazon's warranty policy, no factory warranty? What's that mean? Where are Amazon's stock come from? What about other products?"
1,Better Late than Never!,"I saw a review of one of his newer books and, thinking he was a new writer, looked for it. Then I discovered that he has been published since 1996 and I'd missed him- but I won't let that happen again! This is a first-rate book and, hopefully, series. Kevin Kerney is an intriguing character with lots of layers to be probed. The plot is intriguing although the ending is a bit contrived and the scenery is vivid. I think Kerney is very much like Jake Reacher in the Lee Child's series and I hope he stays that way. An educated and capable vagabond makes a great main character!"
